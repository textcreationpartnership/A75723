         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Age wherein we live, as it is unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in too many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, ſo in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then that it hath almoſt loſt the <hi>ancient Faith</hi> amongſt ſo many Factions which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude others from it. Some we have who have maimed it, by cutting off certain Articles; and others, made a Monſter of it, by hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
<pb facs="tcp:119760:3"/> Additions. Some have deſtroyed it, by corrupting the ſubſtance thereof; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſcoloured it, by counterfeiting its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. Some have poyſoned the Body thereof, by the venime of Hereſies; and others plucked it in pieces, by the violence of Schiſmes. But, what Remedy to cure theſe Corruptions, and Diſorders? Sure we can uſe no better meanes, than what the Prophet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth us unto; <hi>To aske for the old Paths, and walke therein, and ſo find reſt unto our Soules. Ier.</hi> 6. 16. Or to take that courſe which our Bleſſed Saviour made uſe of in deciding the queſtion of Divorces, namely, to reduce the matters in Controverſies unto the Primitive Inſtitution. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 8. By which meanes wee ſhall find (if we make a ſober and impartiall ſearch) what was the <hi>Faith</hi> which the ancient Church received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that which ſhe univerſally profeſt in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, and delivered unto her Children in its native Purity, and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſhall think my paines moſt happily beſtowed, if I may be thought to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed in the leaſt, unto ſo good a Worke, by this enſuing Diſcourſe; the firſt Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereof (that I may give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip an account of its Compoſure) I drew
<pb facs="tcp:119760:3"/> ſome years agoe in purſuance of a Collegiate Office, which then required me to pitch on ſome Fundamentall part of Divinity, which might beſt fit the condition and capacity of the Youth who were then my proper Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours; and ſerve as a Ground-worke to ſettle them in the Principles of Religion.</p>
            <p>In order to this, I thought that I could not make a better choiſe, then by fixing on the <hi>Creed,</hi> which all ages of the Church have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the Apoſtles, and looked on as an exact ſummary of Chriſtian Religion, as to matter of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But before I pitched on the Body of the <hi>Creed</hi> it ſelfe, I judged it very expedient, if not abſolutely neceſſary, to prefixe ſomewhat, by way of Preface, touching the Authors and Authority thereof, which to mee ſeeme to ſtand and fall together; for if the <hi>Creed</hi> were not compoſed by the Apoſtles, but afterwards gathered out of their writings, by ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Hand, not infallibly guided (as theirs) but obnoxious unto Errour; I cannot as yet ſee, how it can well make good its Title of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick,</hi> or juſtly challenge that ſacred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, which it hath univerſally obtained from all Sorts and Sects of Chriſtians, even from the moſt peſtilent of Hereticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And this I was the rather induced to doe,
<pb facs="tcp:119760:4"/> by reaſon of a certain ſhort Treatiſe of a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Countryman of ours, wherein he hath been pleaſed to lay downe ſeverall <hi>Arguments</hi> in diſprovall of the received Authors; the firſt, I ſuppoſe, who ever proceeded ſo farre, and thought fit to imploy his wit and paines on ſo unhappy a Subject. And theſe <hi>Arguments</hi> of his (as Novelties uſually ſpread farther, and take much at their firſt appearance in the world) we have found ſince, not only enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but improved alſo, and augmented in number, by a more Learned Forreiner. I could heartily wiſh, that they had beſtowed their paines upon ſome other Subject, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might have gained a more ſafe repute unto themſelves, and a more ſolid advantage to the Publick; both which are purchaſed, not by battering, and beating downe what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well built and ſetled, but by repairing the Decayes and Breaches of the Chriſtian Church, or by building on the old Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: whereas we may too juſtly ſay of ſuch endeavours as theſe in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> what the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> by an elegant antitheſis, ſpeaks in a matter of fact, <hi>viz. The eating of Things offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Idols,</hi> wherein the <hi>Treſpaſſer</hi> moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly <hi>Scandalized his Brother;</hi> that by this ill-managed knowledge of his, he did <hi>aedificare fratrem in ruinam,</hi> Edify his weaker Brother,
<pb facs="tcp:119760:4"/> but in a moſt perverſe ſenſe, not to feare God, but to fall quite away from him.</p>
            <p>As to my own particular; the objections of theſe two Learned men ſerved opportunely to awaken mee unto a more ſerious and exact Review of thoſe ancient Records, which the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> hath left us; wherein finding juſt Ground, as I conceived, for aſſerting the received <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> by many concordant Teſtimonies of thoſe firſt and beſt Ages; and thoſe ſeconded by the ſuffrages of the moſt eminent Divines of theſe latter Times, although divided into Parties, and differing in many other Poynts; I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to examine the force of the Arguments alleadged to the contrary, in which though I found at the firſt ſight ſome faire Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſufficient to ſtartle an unwary Reader; yet upon a deliberate comparing them with the Conſent, the Cleereneſſe, and the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalneſſe of the contrary proofes, I could by no meanes ſee ſuch a Proportion of weight and force in them, as to overthrow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined ſtrength of ſuch an Army of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>But whether or no, my anſwers to theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections will appeare ſatisfactory unto others, I muſt leave unto thoſe others to judge, who
<pb facs="tcp:119760:5"/> ſee not with my eyes, as I doe not with theirs. Yet I hope that theſe my endeavours will meet with Pardon at leaſt (though they come farre ſhort of that perfection, which they may chance to look for, and I could wiſh for) when they pleaſe to conſider, the ancient and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Right of the Cauſe I plead for; the number and Authority of my witneſſes; by whom I am ſupported; together with the newneſſe of the contrary Arguments, which as no Age before ever ſaw, ſo no Man (to my knowledge) ever went about to ſolve. The firſt attempts in any kind are uſually rude and imperfect; much more, when they proceed from an unskilfull, and unpractiſed Hand, ſuch as mine, which never before ventured on ought which it durſt expoſe unto the Publick view. Yet to excuſe my ſelfe in part from Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity and Preſumption in this particular, I ventured not on it before I had the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Learned Friends, who were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not only to peruſe the Worke, but ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me alſo to the Publication, which if it ſhall awaken ſome more able Pen to perfect what I have thus rudely drawn, I ſhall not a little applaud my ſelfe as the Inſtrument of preſenting ſo fortunate an Occaſion.</p>
            <p>But I have almoſt ſeemed to have forgot
<pb facs="tcp:119760:5"/> your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> whilſt I have been thus parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in relating to you, the Occaſion, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the Progreſſe, and the end of theſe imperfect labours of mine, which I am now bold to offer unto your Patronage, that ſo they may have the ſame Protection with the Author that preſents them. For as the many Favours and Civilities which I have received from your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> hands, oblige me to a Publick acknowledgment, ſo your approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Work (which hath had the Honour of your Peruſall alſo in good part) hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged me to preſent that acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this kind. Beſides, not only Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but ſtrict Juſtice, ſeems to require this oblation at my Hands, the firſt-borne of my Pen; and entitleth your Lordſhip more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly unto it; for though it were begotten elſewhere, it was borne under your Roofe, and ſo belongs unto you, as to the Lord of the Houſe, and the Father of the Family.</p>
            <p>There remaines nought elſe, but that as I now preſent this Treatiſe to your Patronage, ſo to preſent my Prayers to God for your Perſon, for that of your <hi>Noble Lady,</hi> together with all the Branches of your ancient Family; that they may conſtantly Live, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Dye, in the true Chriſtian, <hi>Apostolick
<pb facs="tcp:119760:6"/> Faith, which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> This as it ſtill hath, ſo ſhall continue to be a conſtant part of the dayly Oriſons of</p>

For though it be granted that all the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed</hi> be either expreſſe words of Scripture, or by

                  <p>The <hi>Dogmaticall part</hi> of <hi>Theology,</hi> moſt neceſſary to be eſtabliſhed; and in that, moſt eſpecially the <hi>Creed,</hi> as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the reſt; and this for three <hi>Reaſons.</hi> A double <hi>abuſe</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> which occaſioned this Treatiſe; together with the <hi>abuſe</hi> of <hi>Catechiſmes.</hi> The five Heads of the enſuing Treatiſe. The <hi>Creed</hi> containes all, and only Fundamentals. The <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation,</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> cleared out of it,</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AMongſt the ſeverall parts of Divinity, which brancheth it ſelfe forth ſo largly, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, the Poſitive or Dogmaticall is Beſt, and moſt neceſſary. As for Controverſies, it had been happy for the <hi>Church,</hi> if ſhee had never been exerciſed with any; they aroſe as accidentally, as unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; for <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> hath been the <hi>Mother</hi> of them All: <hi>Ignorance</hi> when men could not; <hi>Malice,</hi> when they would not ſee and acknowledge the <hi>Truth. Truth</hi> it ſelfe is ſtill but <hi>one,</hi> which requires eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing, rather then queſtioning, for whilſt we call all things into Diſpute, even the maine <hi>Grounds</hi> of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> ſome begin to <hi>doubt,</hi> others <hi>deny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, amongſt the Dogmaticks in Divinity, which are reducible to theſe foure Heads, the Principles of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119760:20"/> Chriſtian Catechiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> I have thought good to pitch upon the firſt named, the <hi>Creed,</hi> as the moſt neceſſary and <hi>Fundamentall Part</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and ſo moſt requiſite, to be premiſed unto the other three; for without a right <hi>Faith,</hi> whereof the <hi>Creed</hi> is the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Ground,</hi> we can neither <hi>Pray,</hi> nor <hi>Obey,</hi> nor uſe the the <hi>Sacraments</hi> as we ought; this it is, which directs our Prayers, which quickens our Practice, and diſpoſeth us aright for all Sacred Myſteries.</p>
               <p>But this neceſſity is more preſſing in theſe diſtracted Times, and that for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some we have, and thoſe who would be thought the moſt <hi>Orthodoxe Reformers,</hi> who dare cavill at the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and queſtion the letter of it; yea not only queſtion, but daſh out, and aboliſh the <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Deſcent into Hell,</hi> either in words, or in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and received Senſe, though generally atteſted by the Verdict of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and guarded by the <hi>third Article of our Church,</hi> on purpoſe inſerted, as we may in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood ſuppoſe, for ſetling the minds of her Children in this particular; becauſe it began to be controverted, or at leaſt perverted in the expoſition thereof, by ſome Divines in thoſe Dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others we have of a farre higher ſtraine, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the very <hi>Foundations</hi> of Religion, eſpecially in the <hi>Articles of the Sacred Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> (the eternall Sonne, or word of God made fleſh, by which he became <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) both which are aſſerted in the <hi>Creed,</hi> as will appeare by the following Diſcourſe. And that they might the more boldly vent their deſperate Tenents, have ſlighted the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> as an humane Invention, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; as falſly bearing the <hi>Apoſtles name</hi> in the <hi>Front;</hi> ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119760:21"/> the followers of <hi>Servetus, Valentinus Gentilis, Socinus,</hi> and others. The Framers of which Sects were not aſhamed to divulge their project to the world, as well by the Pencill, as the Pen. They drew a Picture, wherein the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was deſcribed, under the forme of a great Edifice; on the Roofe whereof ſate <hi>Luther,</hi> and his Aſſiſtants, throwing away the Tiles: the Roofe being thus bared, <hi>Zwinglius, Calvin,</hi> and others, beate downe the Walls: when this was done, to perfect the worke, come theſe <hi>Tritheits; Photinians, Arians,</hi> with the reſt of their Conſorts, armed with Spades, and Pick-axes, to digge up the Foundation. Here be Rooters with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoſe deſigne it is not to Prune the Tree, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome ſuperflous Branches, but utterly extirpate it, that they may plant a new Goſpell of their owne; ſuch who inſtead of repairing fall to ruining; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of of reſtoring the Decayes of Gods Church, by a deliberate and well-ordered Reformation; indeavour to erect a new Building, in the Deſolations of the old.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Age miſerably labours with as many Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, almoſt as men, every one ſtrongly &amp; confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretending to the True, and Excommunicating as Reprobates all thoſe, who are either contrarily, or but diverſly minded; in a word, who agree not with them in every Point, though of the ſmalleſt Concernment.</p>
               <p>Amongſt which various Sects and Diviſions, it concernes us, firſt to ſearch out, &amp; then to adhere unto, ſome conſtant <hi>Rule,</hi> whereby to regulate, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh our <hi>Faith.</hi> Now this <hi>Rule</hi> is at Hand; for the <hi>Creed</hi> was anciently ſtiled, and (I hope) is ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by all good Chriſtians, <hi>Regula Fidei;</hi> A ſhort, plaine, certaine, and <hi>Compleat Rule:</hi> Short, without Tediouſneſſe; Plaine, without Perplexedneſſe, or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity; Certaine, without Crookedneſſe, or Errour;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119760:21"/> and Compleat, without Defect: It comprehends the whole Body of our <hi>Beleefe, &amp; omnes Articulos,</hi> all the Joynts or Members of that Body, no one wanting.</p>
               <p>If all Chriſtians would but hold to this, as the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did, then all <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi> would ſoone vaniſh; and the ſeverall Members of the Church, which now lie diſtracted, and torne aſunder, like the <hi>Bones</hi> in <hi>Ezekiels viſion,</hi> the ſevered Parcels of a <hi>Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton,</hi> rather then a Body, would quickly come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Bone to his Bone; the ſinewes, fleſh, and skinne would ſoone cover them; and then, the Breath of the Lord, the Spirit of Chriſt, who is the Head of this Body would Reenter into them, and give them life.</p>
               <p>There have been two Grand Cauſes (as I conceive) of theſe miſerable Diviſions; both ſprung from an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> what by adding to it, what by alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> (contrary to S. <hi>Peters Rule,</hi> from whom ſhee boaſts to derive her Prerogative) <hi>Lording it over Gods Heritage. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 3. And contrary to that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> her <hi>Joynt Founder</hi> taking upon her, to have <hi>Dominion over our Faith, 2 Cor.</hi> 14. hath added <hi>new Articles</hi> to theſe of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> eſpecially in her laſt <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> and theſe ſhe hath enjoyned to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved</hi> under an <hi>Anathema,</hi> and made the ſo <hi>beleeving, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi> Which domineering carriage of hers hath bred many heart-burnings, and ſtirs in the world, that otherwiſe would never have ariſen, if ſhe had kept her ſelf entirely unto the <hi>old Rule,</hi> which only was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be profeſt by the <hi>Genuine</hi> &amp; <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Sons of the <hi>Chuerh,</hi> in the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Beſt Times;</hi> for the <hi>Nicene, Chalcedon,</hi> &amp; other <hi>ſucceeding Creeds,</hi> were only <hi>expoſitions</hi> of, not <hi>Additions</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> as will be made appeare.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:119760:22"/>2. Bold <hi>Sectaries,</hi> under the ſpecious Title of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> taking occaſion and advantage from hence (what from the Tyranny, and what from the example) have fil'd the world with Inſtitutions, and <hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> and (I know not what) ſeverall Tracts of their falſe, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall Tenents, arrogating the name of Truth, and of the true Church unto themſelves: Some Tenents they have urged all to beleeve, which are beſides, and not a few quite contrary to this <hi>Creed</hi> of the Apoſtles; promiſed Salvation to their own Diſciples; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced damnation, not only againſt their oppoſers, but againſt all thoſe too, who concurre not with them in every tittle, and <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a;</hi> whether negative Errours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; or poſitive Doctrines aſſerted. So that now, <hi>Eccleſiam quaerimus in Eccleſiâ,</hi> we have even loſt the Church among ſo many <hi>Conventicles;</hi> we have as many Religions as Families; and thoſe too, not ſeldome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing; yet all appropriating Salvation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Every one takes upon him to be a <hi>Pope,</hi> the name ſo much in ſhew deteſted; and ſeats himſelfe in his uſurped Chaire, as an <hi>infallible Judge,</hi> guided by the Dictates of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> ſo that one knows not whom to adhere to, eſpecially, weake and ignorant Chriſtians are moſt dangerouſly ſcandalized. And, we heard of one not long agoe, in <hi>Holland,</hi> who (whether out of Pride, or Deſpaire, I know not,) had contracted the Church within the ſmall compaſſe of his own <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme;</hi> and upon that Ground (<hi>true Baptiſme</hi> being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next unto the <hi>true Church</hi>) he Baptized himſelfe; thence called the <hi>Se-Baptiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what courſe might be taken to heale theſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous wounds? ſure they would all cloſe up of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if all Chriſtians would have recourſe to this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, Catholick,</hi> and <hi>undoubted Rule;</hi> beleeving as much, requiring no more,</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:119760:22"/>
               <p>And by the way, we may account it none of the leaſt Blemiſhes in the face of our Church, that ſo many private Catechiſmes, with other Tracts of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have been ſuffered to fly abroad from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; not a few of them (for I ſhould offend as much againſt Truth, as modeſty, to cenſure all) erronious; moſt of them defective in the maine Points, yet ſtuff'd with uncertainties, and impertinencies; which inſtead of Fundamentals, give us Circumſtantials and Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixes; inſtead of a ſound Body of <hi>Credenda's,</hi> haire and nailes, if not boiles and botches:</p>
               <p>Thus have the tender Plants in the faire Garden of this Church, been partly infected with a poyſonous joyce, partly made crooked and deformed in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, whilſt they have bent themſelves towards this or that Pamphleter; like thoſe heretofore in the <hi>Church of Corinth;</hi> who ſaid <hi>I am of Paul, I of Apollo's, and I of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> (and 'twere well, they had no worſe Tutours) to the great prejudice of verity, and utter bane of unity.</p>
               <p>Now all this might have been prevented, if they had not thus from the Birth been put forth to ſtrange Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but cauſed to ſuck the Breſts of their true Mother, the Church of England: for S. <hi>Paul</hi> cals the firſt <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion, Milke, a nouriſhment fit for Babes; a good portion of which Milk is contain'd in the <hi>Creed,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> therefore is ſtiled by S. <hi>Cyril Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem, Parvuloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſto lactea Introductio.

               <p>But before I enter upon the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Creed</hi> (which I purpoſe to treat of hereafter, as God ſhall give me life, and ſtrength, meanes, and leaſure) I conceave it will be expedient, if not wholy neceſſary, to lay down by way of Preface or Introduction, ſome <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> which I ſhall reduce to theſe five Heads, the Bounds of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe.</p>

If Tradition were the ſafeſt way to preſerve Things, why were the <hi>Scriptures</hi> written? What is preſerved of the doctrine of the <hi>Diuids,</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates</hi> &amp;c: but what we find written?</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The <hi>Creed</hi> is beſt preſerved by Tradition, for the ſenſe and ſubſtance of the Articles, becauſe daily in publike uſe, in the <hi>Catechumen's</hi> mouthes, and the Liturgies of the Church; yet ſubject to variation in point of expreſſion, by reaſon of ſeverall Tongues, and Dialects in the Chriſtian World; as alſo, becauſe of ſome exegeticall Additions, interſerted upom occaſion of ſome particular Hereſies, which aroſe in this, or that Church. So Lawes are beſt preſerved by continued Practiſe, though ſomewhat varying if received in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Nations (as the <hi>Romane</hi> Lawes are) in ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty of expreſſion; or by way of application to the exigence of the Times, and Genius of the People, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Countries.</p>
               <p>As for the dependance of <hi>Tradition,</hi> it relies not only upon Memory, but upon continuall uſe and Practiſe; a better means of Preſervation, then Writing, which is daily ſubject to the fraud, negligence, and ignorance of Tranſcribers; many differences ariſing from whence,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119760:30"/> have raiſed no ſmall trouble unto Learned <hi>Criticks,</hi> how to reconcile them; or (if irreconcileable) to deſcerne the true Copie. The <hi>Hebrew Bible</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved entire in the true reading thereof, (as being conſtantly uſed in the Jewiſh Synagogues) without any Points, or Vowels written, as now we have it, and that for many hundred yeares, according to the moſt received Opinion; a Thinge infinitely more difficult, then the Preſervation of the <hi>Creed.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may not without Reaſon ſay, that a ſhort Summary of the <hi>Faith,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Creed</hi> is, is beſt kept by Tradition, eſpecially ſuch an one, as is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall uſe and Practiſe; whereof the Fathers here ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted give us good reaſon; in ſumme, that <hi>Non ſunt evul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda fidei myſteria niſi Initiatis, &amp; Magistro Duce, ſeu Interprete; ne ſc: deriſui Profanis habeantur, aut malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium Calumniis pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The whole Word of God was committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe large and full of Variety; yet occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, and by Degrees: The like may be ſaid of the many, long, various Diſcourſes of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> committed to Paper by their Schollers.</p>
               <p>Our Saviours Sermons, and Diſcourſes were oft very large, his Miracles, and memorable paſſages of his Life, almoſt infinite; and ſo could not otherwiſe be well preſerved, then by Writing; yet <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tels us, that many Chriſtian Nations had no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture amongſt them in his Time, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept Chriſtianity diligently amongſt them by an old <hi>Tradition.</hi> And on the other ſide, the Fathers tell us, that where the Scriptures were to be had, the Hereticks oft ſet forth unſound Books under the Apoſtles names, and corrupted the true Copies

               <p>As for the doctrine of the <hi>Druids,</hi> it was carefully preſerved (as long as the Religion ſtood) by <hi>an unwritten Tradition;</hi> now Chriſtianity hath a promiſe of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance unto the end of the world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. &amp; ſo needs no more to feare a failing of its doctrine, then its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</p>
               <p>If it be farther objected, that all in generall are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>confeſſe Christ,</hi> and to <hi>give an account of the hope that is in them. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 15. which ſeems to make againſt the ſecond Reaſon, aſſigned by <hi>Cyril of Ieruſalem.</hi> That the <hi>Creed was of old committed to writing by Irenaeus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> &amp; that when theſe Reaſons, and exhortations were made by <hi>Ruffin, Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Chryſologus,</hi> the <hi>Creed</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing both by themſelves, and others.</p>
               <p>I <hi>anſwer;</hi> firſt that thoſe Precepts belong properly to <hi>Christians,</hi> that is, to Perſons entered into the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> who had the whole <hi>Creed</hi> explained unto them: but if they extend to the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Account</hi> muſt be underſtood more indefinitely, and at large, to wit, of thoſe more eaſie and generall Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whereof they were informed by their Teachers.

               <p>As for other <hi>Summaries</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> they cannot be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo truely, or ſo properly called the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> becauſe they want the Atteſtation of the Church, which never acknowledged them for ſuch; though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe perhaps in ſubſtance they agree with it, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſes, or parts thereof.</p>
               <p>The New Teſtament containes many things, beſides the fundamentall <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Beleefe;</hi> as ſmaller Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Points, Evangelicall Rules of Practice, matters of Hiſtory, Diſputes, Prophecies &amp;c.

               <p>As for explicating, or altering the <hi>Creed;</hi> we may ſafely paraphraſe, or comment on it now, though not alter the Text thereof in wordes or ſenſe; becauſe it hath been delivered to us <hi>totidem verbis</hi> by a confeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident <hi>Tradition</hi> of above 1200 years, as the Oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of its <hi>Authors</hi> are forced to yeeld. Before it was thus ſetled, there was more liberty of expreſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diverſe Churches ſomewhat varied the <hi>Forme,</hi> by reaſon of ſuccreſent <hi>Hereſis;</hi> but now it hath trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over all, and is long agoe ſetled in full poſſeſſion of the Chriſtian <hi>Faith.</hi> Beſides in all thoſe former va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations, though the <hi>Forme</hi> was changed in ſome few Particulars, yet the heads or <hi>Articles of Beleefe,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the ſame; It was not therefore ſufficient for any confeſſion of <hi>Faith</hi> to gaine the Title of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> in that it contained nothing but Truth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have ſeene what light the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> gives us, concerning this <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> but this Truth will be farther cleered and confirmed, by the concordant <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> and moſt of thoſe the moſt <hi>ancient</hi> for Time, as living neereſt the age of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and the moſt <hi>venerable</hi> for <hi>Authority;</hi> who therefore may beſt be credited in this matter, and well ſpeake for the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now in reciting their Teſtimonies, when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome of them, who in their writings ſet downe the <hi>Creed</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> not agreeing <hi>totidem verbis</hi> expreſſely in every word and tittle, with that, which the Church now receives for the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> I ſhall deſire my Reader to take notice of theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, that diverſe of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Heretickes</hi> of their Times, mentiond only, or chiefly, thoſe <hi>Articles,</hi> which were then cald in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by thoſe againſt whom they wrote; whence it is, that they doe not alwaies ſet the <hi>Creed</hi> downe whole
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119760:42"/> and entire: which by the way, may well be one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Chriſts deſcent into Hell</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in many latter <hi>Creeds;</hi> becauſe never queſtion'd by any of the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of thoſe dayes. The ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon induced the <hi>Nicene Fathers,</hi> to proceed no farther in their <hi>Creed</hi> than this <hi>Article</hi>—&amp; in <hi>Spiritum Sanctum,</hi> And <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghost;</hi> although the old <hi>Creed</hi> was larger (as will appeare more fully in what I ſhall produce hereafter;) namely, becauſe the <hi>Arian contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy</hi> required no more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> maine care in ſetting down this <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> was, to keep themſelves to the ſame Heads or <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> giving themſelves ſomtimes liberty to vary words &amp; phraſes; whence it is, that though they alwayes, ſet downe the <hi>Creed,</hi> whereſoever they mention it, as the only, <hi>neceſſary, unchangeable Rule</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>immoveable Baſis</hi> of Chriſtianity, the diſtinctive <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured marke of a true, orthodoxe Chriſtian, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhing him, to <hi>Pagans, Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> yet ſomtimes, as learned Diſcourſers, they enlarge the parts of the <hi>Creed</hi> by way of <hi>Paraphraſe:</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles, as ſhort Compriſers thereof, they contract the ſum of it into fewer words, according as they ſaw cauſe, or had occaſion offered. So <hi>Tertullian,</hi> though he lay downe this for a ground, that—<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula fidei una omninò eſt, ſola immobilis &amp; irreformabilis, The Rule of faith is only one, ſoley immoveable, and umchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable.</hi> De <hi>Virg.</hi> vel <hi>chap.</hi> 1. Yet whereas he thriſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſeth it in three ſeverall Tracts, he never uſeth the ſame words exactly, but varyeth his expreſſion; now extending, now contracting it at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is an other reaſon why ſome of the <hi>Creeds</hi> end with the <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> viz: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119760:42"/> the <hi>four</hi> following <hi>Articles</hi> are virtually included in it, which appeares by S. <hi>Chryſoſtomes firſt Homily on the Creed,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewen by and by.</p>
               <p>As for us of this Age we are not unjuſtly abridged the like liberty, in varying of words or phraſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe theſe are ſuſpected times, wherein the very <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> are by many very doubtfully held, and by ſome cal'd in queſtion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the Forme is now on all hands confeſſedly ancient, fully ſetled, and ſtrictly enjoyned for ſo many Ages; whereas the Fathers lived in a Time, when ſeverall Churches uſed to vary in the expreſſion of ſeverall <hi>Articles;</hi> and they themſelves were knowne Champions of the <hi>Faith,</hi> againſt the Heretickes which then a roſe. The caſe is much the ſame in the number of Canonicall Bookes, which is now a like aknowledged by all and entirely ſetled, (at leaſtwiſe in thoſe of the New Teſtament) but not ſo heretofore: Or, in the Tranſlations of the Bible, which every one at the firſt, who had ſome skill in the Greek Tongue tooke upon him to performe; as <hi>S. Aug:</hi> tells us. <hi>Doct: Chriſt. lib: 2. cap:</hi> 12. Yet it is Prudence in the Church to tie her children ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the uſe of one tranſlation now (though not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring the learneds recourſe unto the Originals) when as there are ſo many Diviſions, Opinions, Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, Controverſies, about matter of Religion, and ſuch a multitud of Schiſmes thence ariſing, which might be probably continued and increaſed by ſuch a promiſcuous licenſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> in their <hi>Catechiſticall Paraphraſes</hi> on the <hi>Creed,</hi> which they made to the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> before they were admitted unto Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; ſomtimes intermixed matter of a diverſe kind,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119760:43"/> 
                  <hi>viz. Practicall Heads</hi> or <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> equally neceſſary for the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Auditours; ſo doth <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his <hi>Catacheſes.</hi> And in their other Tracts, wherin they dogmatically explain it, they ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adde ſome exegeticall Particles againſt the Hereticks of thoſe dayes, the more clearly to confute them, and forearme their Diſciples againſt their poyſonous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; ſo ſome of the <hi>Eaſterne Churches</hi> in the <hi>Firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> added theſe <hi>two Attributes</hi> by way of expoſition to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father viz. Inviſible</hi> and <hi>Impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> thus contradiſtinguiſhing God the <hi>Father</hi> to God the <hi>Sonne</hi> and contradiſtinguiſhing themſelves to the <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Patri-paſſians,</hi> who confounded the two Perſons,</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding all theſe ſeeming Differences, the indifferent Reader will eaſily find, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd <hi>Symboles</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> which they ſet downe in their writings doe plainly relate to this <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe they affirme that they received them from the Apoſtles whereas no <hi>Creed</hi> ever bore their name but this one which the Church now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth under that Title.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they uſe the ſame method in ſetting downe the <hi>Articles,</hi> and commonly they make uſe of the ſame words.</p>
               <p>This premiſed; I come now to ſet downe their Authorities in order as they lie begining with the moſt ancient, and ſo deſcending to latter times. And firſt of the <hi>Greeke Fathers</hi> who ſhew what <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> was received in the <hi>Churches of the Eaſt.</hi> Theſe <hi>witneſſes</hi> are <hi>eight</hi> in number, <hi>viz.

And: 2. 5, 9.</p>
               <p>As for his <hi>Deſcent into Hell,</hi> Chriſt only is mentioned in it, not any that bore him company thither; for which, ſee <hi>Act. 2. 29, 31. Eſa.</hi> 63. 1, 3.

               <p>But if any make doubt of the truth of this ſtory, wherin <hi>Euſebius</hi> brings in <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> rehearſing theſe <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed;</hi> I ſhall deſire them impartially to conſider, that it was found by him in the Records of the Citty <hi>Edeſſa</hi> where this <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> Preached; and tranſlated by the ſame <hi>Euſebius</hi> out of the <hi>Syria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And what better witneſſe of thoſe Records, then he that ſaw them, and copied out the originall with his owne hand?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ignatius</hi> that famous <hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> contemporary to the Apoſtls; having occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to confute ſom <hi>Hereticks</hi> of thoſe Times, who

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Then in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Tralles,</hi> he ſets downe the ſame Articles in like words, which will not be unworthy our comparing—<hi>Stop your ears,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when any one ſpeakes to you, excluding Jeſus Chriſt</hi>—</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Compare theſe to gither, and they preſent us with theſe Articles, which touch our Saviour—1. <hi>That he is the Sonne of God begotten of the Father before all Worlds. 2. That he was borne, in time, of the Virgin Mary,</hi> without the company of man borne truly of the Virgin, as as he was begotten of God; but not in like
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119760:45"/> manner, God and Man being of diverſe natures. 3. <hi>That he ſuffered, was crucifyed &amp; died under Pontius Pilate. 4. That he deſcended into Hell and roſe againe after three Dayes. 5. That he aſcended up to his Father into Heaven, and ſitteth on his right Hand. 6. That he ſhall come at the end of the world, to judge both the quicke and the dead, and to render to every man according to his workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe the doctrine of the Trinity lies more implicitely couched in the <hi>Creed,</hi> he expreſſeth it more at large in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Philippi,</hi> in theſe words—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is—<q>There are not three Fathers, nor three Sons, nor three Comforters; but one Father and one Son, and one comforter; wherfore, the Lord ſending his Apoſtles to teach all Nations, commanded them to Baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne and of the Holy Ghoſt; not into one with three names, or into three made man, but into the name of three of the ſame Dignity; for one of them only was made man, not the Father, nor the Comforter, but the Sonne alone; and that, not in opinion, or appearance, but in Truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If any one queſtion the truth of theſe Epiſtles (out of which I have produced theſe paſſages) whether they were written by <hi>Ignatius</hi> or no I ſhall deſire him as well to diſprove, as to deny, for Elſe nothing of Antiquity, which agrees not with every ons fancy ſhall

               <p>From theſe Teſtimonies of the Greeke Fathers, who can beſt witneſſe the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Eaſterne Churches,</hi> we may raiſe theſe obſervations; but more eſpecially, from the two Creeds of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> (to which we may adde that of <hi>Arius.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> received the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed</hi> by <hi>Tradition,</hi> as well as the <hi>Latine Church;</hi> therefore it was no compoſure of the <hi>Romane Clergy,</hi> as ſome invidiouſly affirme.</p>

               <p>I am not ignorant that not a few among the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doubt of this Epiſtle whether it truly belong to <hi>Clemens,</hi> or be a counterfeit ſet forth under his name, as many Decretal Epiſtles have beene falſly aſcribed to ſeverall of the Ancient Biſhops of Rome; and they bring this for the cheife, if not only, reaſon of their Doubt, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Epiſtle, which is entituled unto <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Brother of the Lord,</hi> makes mention therein of the Death of <hi>Peter,</hi> whereas <hi>Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For the ſatisfaction of which doubt, I ſhall deſire my Reader to conſider what followes.</p>
               <p>Firſt that the ſtile of this Epiſtle reliſheth of the Ancient primitive Simplicity, and that it is entitled, To the Brother of the Lord, with this Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—<q>Epiſcopo Epiſcoporum, regenti He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeorum ſanctam Eccleſiam Hieroſolymis, ſed &amp; omnes Eccleſias quae ubique Dei Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiâ fundatae ſuut.</q> In which words the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this epiſtle gives this <hi>Iames</hi> two eminent Titles, namely, <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;</hi> and both of them, I conceive, in regard of his See <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where he was conſtituted the firſt Biſhop that ever was in the Chriſtian World; the Biſhop of that Church, from which all other Churches ſprang, as ſo many Daughters from the Mother Church, and therfore were to honour her acording<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. Now we know that in after Ages the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was taxed for challenging to himſelfe the Title of <hi>Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum</hi> (as <hi>Stephen</hi> by S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian; Conc. Carthag. apud Cyp.</hi>) and univerſall Biſhop (which <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>third</hi> aſſumed by the grant of the <hi>Emperour Phocas</hi>) whereas here theſe Titles are not challenged by <hi>Clemens</hi> Biſhop of Rome, but voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to an other; it is therefore wholy improbable, that this Epiſtle was fained by ſome latter writer (as many of the decretall Epiſtles have bene ſince) under the name of <hi>Clemens,</hi> to magnify the Biſhop of Romes Authority, ſince, <hi>nemo gratis mendax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Ruffinus</hi> the forenamed <hi>Preſbyter</hi> of <hi>Aquileia,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:119760:54"/> tranſlated it out of Greeke into Latine, as the genuine Epiſtle of <hi>Clemens,</hi> it appeares there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it was written at firſt in Greeke (as was alſo, that famous Epiſtle of his to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) ſo not by ſome latter Romane Author; and (at leaſt) before the time of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> who flouriſhed toward the latter end of the fourth Century.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Epiſtle might probably be thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>Fratri Domini, To the Lords Brother;</hi> then ſome latter <hi>Sciolus,</hi> finding <hi>James</hi> peculiarly honoured with this Title by S. <hi>Paul Gal. 2, v.</hi> 9. And finding that he about that Time was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> too raſhly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the name, <hi>Iacobo:</hi> whenas, <hi>Clemens</hi> might well write it <hi>Simoni Cleophae</hi> the <hi>Brother of Iames,</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour in that See: his Brother, as appeares by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Mat. 13. 55. Mar. 15. 40. Ioh.</hi> 19, 25. And his ſucceſſour in the Biſhoprick, as is witneſſed by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; But if the name [<hi>Iacobo</hi>] muſt needes ſtand we may poſſibly ſuppoſe, that <hi>Clemens</hi> ſo farr off, might not heare of the death of <hi>Iames.</hi> (as the Jews at Rome heard no evill report of S, <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 28. 21. from their countrymen in the Eaſt though for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years they had perſecuted him both with tongue, and hand) and ſo write to him as alive: or, if this ſeem not probable, we have a very faire teſtimony out of the <hi>Chronicle</hi> called <hi>Epitome Temporum,</hi> that this <hi>Iames</hi> ſurvived <hi>Nero,</hi> and conſequently ſurvived <hi>Peter</hi> (this Chronicle was ſet forth by <hi>Ioſ.

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:119760:65"/>
               <p>Now, for a concluſion to theſe <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> both Greek, and Latine, I ſhall ſumme up what they ſay, and proove in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in three ſhort obſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They affirme, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, &amp; the ſpeciall Concurrence or Inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, framed a certaine <hi>ſet Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Forme of Beliefe;</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Confeſſions</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> which they rehearſe in their writings were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and this they build upon the conſtant tradition of their Anceſtours; the ſame evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which we have, for the number, Authors, and Authority of the Canonicall Books of Scripture. This is affirmed by <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus of Ancyra,</hi> for the <hi>Esterne Church;</hi> By <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> for the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern;</hi> all foure very Ancient, to name no latter ones.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That, in ſetting downe theſe <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Confeſſions of Faith</hi> they keepe themſelves often to the ſame words, ordinarily to the ſame method, but conſtantly to the ſame heads or <hi>Articles of Faith;</hi> that is, no <hi>Head,</hi> or <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Beliefe</hi> ſet downe in the <hi>Creed</hi> of one <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Father,</hi> is different in ſenſe from the ſame proportionably ſet downe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; much leſſe oppoſite to any diverſe <hi>Article</hi> either precedent or ſubſequent; and for the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of expreſſion, it is not conſiderable, as being cauſed by the diverſity of Tongues, and oppoſition of Heretickes, the Church in thoſe Times both practiſing, and allowing it. As for the Imperfection of the <hi>Formes;</hi> though they omit (ſome of them) to expreſſe ſome of the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed</hi> in thoſe full and exact Termes wherein we now have them, becauſe either not pertaining
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119760:66"/> to the ſubject they were handling, or not queſtiond by the Hereticks againſt whom they wrote, or as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and incloſed in the Body of thoſe <hi>Articles</hi> which they ſet downe, by a neceſſary Dependance (ſo S. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> in his fore-cited Homily involves the foure laſt <hi>Articles</hi> in that of the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> as appeares by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication) yet ſome of them ſet downe all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as <hi>Marcellus, Cyrill Jeros, Auguſtin; Chryſologus, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius Gallicanus; Irenaeus</hi> alſo and <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſcarce want any one; eſpecially <hi>Tertullian;</hi> And for thoſe Fathers whoſe <hi>Formes</hi> are more defective, they canot be ſaid to differ in ſubſtance from the other who deliver the <hi>Creed</hi> more fully; eſpecially ſeeing they had ſeverall Grounds and occaſions for what they ſo did; this is a Diverſity only <hi>quoad majus &amp; minus;</hi> in quantity, not in ſubſtance; ſome Articles made for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one Fathers purpoſe, ſome for another; more for this, fewer for that: And they who cite the <hi>Creed</hi> defectively, ſay that the Formes ſet downe by them, came from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as well as they who ſet it downe more fully, their meaning is, that thoſe imperfect <hi>Formes</hi> came from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> though not ſo imperfectly, for they affirme not, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> delivered no more <hi>Articles</hi> than what they there ſet downe, but that what they ſo ſet down came from no other than the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> and <hi>Leo the Great</hi> ſufficiently informe us, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> joyntly delivered all the <hi>twelve Articles,</hi> according as we now have them, for they diſtinctly mention and reckon up ſo many with reference to the ſame number of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who compoſed the <hi>Creed;</hi> but the Fathers in their writings ſet them not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes downe entirely, but thoſe only which were oppoſite unto thoſe Hereſies that they were in hand with to confute; for urging the <hi>Creed</hi> (as they did)
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119760:66"/> by way of Argument, and Convictions they might well omit thoſe <hi>Articles</hi> which made not for their purpoſe. Now, as ſome of the Fathers have thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the <hi>Creed,</hi> ſo others have enlarged part of the <hi>Articles</hi> by way of Paraphraſe, that ſo they might both diſtinguiſh themſelves, and defend the Church, from the Hereticks of thoſe Dayes, who ſeemingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> and ſubſcribed to the words, but perverted it to a wrong ſenſe, by their falſe, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Gloſſes. Withall in their prefaces to this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they have ſhewed the ſeverall Reaſons or ends for which the Apoſtles framed it, the Delivery thereof by an orall Tradition, and the Ancient Cuſtome of rehearſing it in Publick, at the time of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſome of theſe fore-alleadged Fathers lived before, others ſince the <hi>Nicene Councell,</hi> wherein that <hi>Creed</hi> was framed which beares the name of the <hi>Councell,</hi> the firſt which was ever publickly authorized by the Church aſſembled in a Synod: yet they who lived before the Councell, make mention of a former <hi>Creed,</hi> as <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian, Origen;</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> of <hi>Ancyra;</hi> and they who lived afterward, ſet not downe, or explaine the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> but one farre more ancient, received, as they themſelves ſay, from the firſt Founders of the Chriſtian Church; as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>Theſe Teſtimonies then, may juſtly much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with thoſe who profeſſe themſelves of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches; not only, becauſe of the Dignity of their Name, and the uncorruptneſſe of their writings (as being compoſed of late, &amp; not at all ſuſpected of coruption by any Romiſh fraud) but alſo, that when they ſpeake of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> they queſtionleſſe meane that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Hereby alſo, two ſorts of men may likewiſe ſee their errour. Firſt, the <hi>Romane-Catholik,</hi> who with alike loudnes and lying proclaimes to the world, that the Proteſtant or Reformed Churches have brought in a new Religion, whereas their endeavour hath been to reſtore the old unto its Primitive Simplicity, by paring off from it, as well eroneous ſuperſtructures in matter of Doctrine, as Superſtitious or Burdenous Appendixes in matter of Ceremonies, Diſcipline, Government, and Manners. Secondly, the <hi>Novelliſt,</hi> who though he ſeemes outwardly much to honour the Prime Reformers, yet adheres not to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but runs wildly after his owne Inventions, fooliſhly meaſuring the Truth of Religion by its oppoſition to the Church of Rome, as if ſhee had wholy apoſtatized from the <hi>Faith.</hi> Now betweene theſe two extreames, the old Catholick Truth keeps a mean, though for this cauſe much ſuffering on both ſides. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19. But Wiſdome is juſtifyed of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Among theſe Proteſtant Divines, I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Teſtimonies of <hi>Calvin, Beza, Grynaeus,</hi> and <hi>Paraeus,</hi> in their Comments on the fore-alleaged Places of Scripture, <hi>viz.

The <hi>Title</hi> which it bears of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> or <hi>Symbole</hi> hath been generally acknowledged throughout all ages of the Church, &amp; never queſtioned till of late; cheefly by our moderne Antitrinitarians.

               <p>But to this Reaſon, I find three things Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. Againſt the Name [<hi>Symbolum.</hi>] From whence ſome draw an Argument that it was joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> becauſe the Word is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But this diſtinction, (ſaith the objectour) or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſeverall Articles might be made by <hi>Apoſtolick Men,</hi> and their Diſciples, out of the holy Scripture and from thence obtaine the name of the <hi>Apoſtolick Symbole.</hi> But [it might be ſo] and [it was ſo] are two things: If it might be ſo, it might be otherwiſe; ſure this private, groundles conjecture, may well give place to the conſtant aſſertion of ſo many Ancient and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Authors, who affirme the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to have been the <hi>Compoſers</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and give that for the reaſon of the name which it beares.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:119760:77"/>
               <p>As for the Teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius, Hom.</hi> 1. in <hi>Symb.</hi> who is there produced to ſay that the Creed was written, not by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> but by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Churches;</hi> he hath no ſuch excluſive words, as <hi>[non ab Apoſtolis quidem]</hi> but ſaith that the <hi>Fathers of the Churches</hi> (whom a litle after he calls <hi>Magiſtri,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> of the ſayd <hi>Churches) Compoſed</hi> the Creed; Now, who be theſe but the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> expreſt by way of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphraſis;</hi> for they, and they only may properly be called the <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Maſters,</hi> not of this or that <hi>Church</hi> in particular, but of all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the World, their Comiſſion Being generall; <hi>Goe, and Teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Math.</hi> 29. 19. Whereas others were limited to this or that Church, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them; and were the Sonnes, or Diſciples of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> termes <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> in his Epiſtles which he wrote unto them. 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 4. Hence alſo it is, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> tels his Corinthians 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 15. Though ye have ten thouſand instructers in Chriſt, yet have ye not many Fathers, for in Chriſt Jeſus I have Begotten you through the Goſpell,</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>This conjecture therefore deſerves as litle faith, as it hath foundation, that is, none at all; for the Fathers conſtantly ſay it was called The Apoſtles Creed, becauſe Framed by, and derived to the Chriſtian Church, from the Apoſtles of Chriſt; and this may juſtly ſway us in this Caſe; for the Title prefixt doth not only beare this conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but more directly points out, and inclines
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119760:77"/> us to this meaning; Titles being therefore given, that they may deſigne the Authors, or Compoſers of that worke unto which they are prefixt; and the Fathers living in the firſt Ages ſhould beſt know the Tradition; the Title then of the Apoſtles Creed is not nakedly produced as a convincing Argument, but as backt, and ſeconded with the Atteſtation of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>As for the contrary Inſtance of the Canons of the Apoſtles, although they beare the name of <hi>Clemens</hi> in the Inſcription, who firſt gatherd them into one Body, yet they may well challenge the <hi>Apostles</hi> for the <hi>Authors,</hi> who firſt inſtituted, and put them in Practiſe.</p>
               <p>Then, as to the promiſcuous uſe of the name <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and <hi>Apostolick</hi> and the applying of them to the Ancient Biſhops it will not hurt at all, or prejudice the <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> Becauſe the Fathers entitle it to the <hi>Apostles</hi> ſo cal'd <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119760:79"/> broacheth ſome new opinion of his owne, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines one lately held, and taken up by ſome few; not ſo, when the Affirmer relies upon a Tradition of ſo many yeares ſtanding, and this Tradition confeſt by the Adverſary, as this of the Creed is; for ſuch a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as this, is a ſufficient [<hi>muſt be</hi>] unleſſe the falſity or miſtake thereof can be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the reaſon of the name delivered in the objection, doth notat all oppoſe, but agree with the Tradition; for the Apoſtles might well deliver in the Creed, the ſummary of what they were to Preach more at large; and, that the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> comes neareſt of any other to the words of the Apoſtles in their writings, argues them, rather than any other, for the Compoſers of it.</p>

And wee have already in part demonſtrated the ſame, out of the forecited Fathers; particularly, out of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies on the Creed, which they commonly made on <hi>Palmeſunday</hi> to the <hi>Competentes,</hi> who were now ready to be baptized. But now, when <hi>Eaſter</hi> came, the ſolemne time of Baptiſme (as <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> alſo was) before they were admitted to it, they made an open confeſſion of their <hi>Faith,</hi> as our Infants now doe in the Perſon of their Godfathers.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:119760:81"/>
               <p>I aske then what confeſſion of Faith was this, which they thus publiquely pronounced at Baptiſme? No man is ſo abſurd to think, that every one was left to his owne diſcretion, to frame it as he pleaſed, but that the Church had a certaine preſcribed <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>words,</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Beliefe,</hi> which the Competentes did openly rehearſe; the ſame <hi>forme</hi> no doubt, which had been explained unto them on the foregoing <hi>Palmeſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> now, this was no other then the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> as appears both by thoſe Homilies of the Fathers upon it, which were uſually made to the Competentes on Palmeſunday, as preparatives to their Baptiſme; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, becauſe we find no other <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely received in the Church, for above 300 years after the Birth of our Saviour, beſides this of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
               <p>To this agree the words of Saint <hi>Jerome, cont. Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Solenne eſt in lavacro, poſt Trinitatis confeſſionem, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogare; Credis in ſanctam Eccleſiam? credis remiſſionem peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum?</hi> That is, It is the cuſtome at Baptiſme, after confeſſion of the Trinity, to aske; Believeſt thou the Holy Church? believeſt thou the Remiſſion of ſinnes?</p>

We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that remiſſion of ſinnes is not given but in the Church.</p>
               <p>If any one deſire to have this Cuſtome of rehearſing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119760:82"/> the Creed at Baptiſme, brought higher yet, up to the Age of the Apoſtles, that ſo we may know poſitively when this forme of Profeſſion began; and the rather, becauſe when the Apoſtles baptized 3000 in one day, and preſently after S. <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, either no <hi>forme</hi> was then uſed, or it was a very ſhort one, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That the cuſtome of making Homilies on the Creed by the Catechiſts, and Biſhops of old, for the better inſtruction of thoſe who were to be Baptized, ſhews that this confeſſion was very anciently practiſed; and <hi>Ruſſinus</hi> (who himſelfe was ancient) tells us of many <hi>Illuſtres Tractatores,</hi> many famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of the Creed in this kind, before his Time; why then may not we juſtly referre that cuſtome to the Age of the Apoſtles, whereof we can find no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the Church?</p>
               <p>But to give you a more Poſitive and Expreſſe proofe, that place in the Firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> cap. 6. v. 12. where he is ſaid, <hi>to have made a good Profeſſion before many witneſſes,</hi> is underſtood of the Profeſſion of the Creed at his Baptiſme, by S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and <hi>Occumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> And that other paſſage, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. of <hi>Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and the doctrine of Baptiſmes,</hi> which are there joyned together; is underſtood in the ſame ſenſe, by <hi>Chryſoſtome, Auguſtine, Oecumenius, Theophylact;</hi> and, of latter times, by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Panaeus,</hi> as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
               <p>Then, for the inſtance of S. <hi>Peters</hi> 3000 co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verts, it is not ſaid that they were <hi>Baptized</hi> all in one day (which can hardly be judged probable at that time, for want of hands enough to the worke, want of water about <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the danger of making ſo publique a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme) but <hi>added to the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>dederunt nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na

               <p>As for their Confeſſion of Faith, whether the <hi>ſame Day</hi> or afterwards; I readily grant, that it could not be then framed in the words of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> which was not ſo early compoſed, but inſtead of that they publiquely atteſted to the Truth of Saint <hi>Peters Sermon,</hi> which contained the fundamentalls of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that were after ſuccinctly gathered into one Body in the Summary of the Creed; which was thence forward the ſole <hi>forme of Confeſsion,</hi> or <hi>Beliefe</hi> uſed at the time of Baptiſme, for none other we finde then uſed.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſome of the firſt converſions were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and ſo not to be drawn into example, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, ſet Patternes of the Churches ſucceeding Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; the Apoſtles had the gift of diſcerning faith in the heart, and ſo needed not alwaies expect an open Profeſſion; whereas others, in following Times, who had not the ſame Gift, were tied to the ordinary Rule and method of proceeding: thus the ſame Apoſtle cauſed <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends to be Baptized (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>formall Profeſſion</hi> of their Faith that we read of) becauſe he perceived that the Holy Ghoſt was powred on them.

               <p>Now this Creed of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which ſo nearely ſymbolizeth with that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> deſerves no meane regard; Firſt, becauſe, he is a very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Doctor of the Church, as who flouriſhed about the end of the ſecond Century. Secondly, becauſe his workes are confeſſedly genuine. Thirdly, and Chiefly, becauſe this Creed of his ſetting downe was not Framed by him, (but as he expreſſely tells us) derived from Chriſt, by the mouthes of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> before ever any Heretick appeared in the Church; ſo it was not made becauſe of hereſies now riſen (whereof many aroſe even in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Times) but before any of them aroſe; not for Remedy, but prevention, and therefore muſt needs be very ancient.</p>
               <p>But in the two other places, he ſets down this <hi>Creed</hi> or Rule of Faith more imperfectly, omitting what made not for his preſent purpoſe: yet thoſe imperfect Creeds he calls <hi>Regulas immobiles &amp; irreformabiles; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable and unchangeable Rules,</hi> that is, in regard of thoſe <hi>Heades</hi> of <hi>Beliefe</hi> which he had occaſion th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

               <p>So that all the Creeds which wee meet with in the Fathers or Councells, are to be compared with that which the Church for ſo many Ages hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the Apoſtles, as ſo many Copies with the Patterne, or Structures with the modell: not ſo well with one another; for ſo they may differ in poynt of quantity and proportion; like ſo many Pictures or Statues made to repreſent the ſame body, whereof the originall is entire and exactly proportioned, but the copies diverſely ſhaped, and drawn; ſome too Giant. like; others too defectively, to the middle only, or the ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>If it be farther objected, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affirme all their new Articles to be only Explications of the old, and confeſſe that Articles cannot increaſe <hi>quoad numerum credibilium, ſed quoad explicationem;</hi> yet, that we condemne them juſtly for obtruding thoſe explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; that the <hi>Romanists</hi> are juſtly blamed for obtruding their explications on other Churches, as neceſſary to Salvation, becauſe themſelves make but a particular Church and yet preſume upon a falſe priviledge of univerſall primacy, and Apoſtolick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.

               <p>This <hi>Cyril</hi> was firſt Catechiſt, then <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and ſate afterwards in the firſt Councell held at

                  <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Eaſterne Biſhops were only preſent, and compoſed a <hi>Creed</hi> almoſt in the ſame termes with this of <hi>Cyril:</hi> He compoſed theſe <hi>Cateche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in his youth, about the yeare 350; and died in the yeare 386, five years after the celebration of that Councell; as the learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> demonſtrates out of <hi>Leo</hi> and S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> compared with a paſſage in his ſixt <hi>Catecheſis.</hi> Now, as the Fathers of the firſt Councell at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> laboured not to frame a new Creed, but were contented to enlarge the Article concerning the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> againſt <hi>Macedonius</hi> who perverted it: ſo, we may juſtly ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> retained the words of that Creed, which had been of old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> (leaſt they might, otherwiſe, ſeeme to have framed a new <hi>Faith</hi>) amplifying only the Article concerning the <hi>Divinity of our Saviour,</hi> which was then called in queſtion by <hi>Arius;</hi> that ſo it might appeare to the World, <hi>quaedam tantummodo explicatius di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Voſſius</hi> rightly conceives.

               <p>Therefore, to think that <hi>Cyril</hi> in his old Age, or <hi>Iohn the Patriarch</hi> his Succeſſor, added all that to the <hi>Jeroſolymitan Creed,</hi> which followes the Articles of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is nothing probable, becauſe <hi>Cyril</hi> doth not barely ſet downe the Articles, but Catechetically

               <p>The firſt, that of <hi>Adrichomius,</hi> who thinkes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the place was <hi>Caenaculum Sion,</hi> a Place fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for many other ſacred Actions, as wherein our Bleſſed Saviour celebrated his laſt Supper, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the moſt holy Euchariſt; wherein, the Holy Ghoſt deſcended on the Apoſtles at Pentecoſt; and wherein, they held that famous Councell about the abrogating of the Ceremoniall Law. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly to which Tradition, he brings that ſaying of the Evangelicall Prophet, <hi>Out of Syon ſhall goe forth the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119760:90"/> Law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem. Iſa.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that of <hi>Frier Anſelme,</hi> and others; that the place, where the Apoſtles framed the Creed, was on <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> three Bow-ſhootes from the place where Chriſt is ſaid to have wept over <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for which he gives this reaſon. <q>Quia eſt communis in partibus iſtis Traditio, perpetuis monumentis a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibus confirmata, qui ibi antiquitùs pulchram eo intuitu aedificarunt Eccleſiam, ſub titulo S. Marci Evangeliſtae, ut in vetuſto MS. libello de locis ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis exaratum inveni, &amp; meminit Fr. Anſelmus; &amp; non modica illius fundamenta, &amp; ruinae adhuc cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntur. Subtùs eſt pulchra oblonga ciſterna in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus both opinions agree in the maine, that there was a certaine place wherein the Apoſtles aſſembled to compoſe the Creed, although they ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer about the aſſignation thereof; which circumſtance is not much materiall, eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Adrichomius</hi> delivers his opinion but as a probable conjecture; which may therefore well give place unto the latter, as being fortified with the more convincing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of an ancient, well-grounded Tradition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Neighbouring Inhabitants, and of a Church built in the memoriall thereof, with a large Ciſterne underneath, hewen out of the maine Rock, having twelve cavities in it according to the number of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And thus, at length, have I run through my
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119760:91"/> Proofes, drawne from <hi>Scripture, Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> which, I hope, may prevaile with any indifferent judgment, to acknowledge this Creed for the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Apoſtles, rather than upon ſome few weak conjecturall Grounds, to deny thoſe Compoſers, which the Title points us to; and then aſcribe it to I know not what Nameleſſe, and uncertain Authors, at an indefinite, and uncerteine Time, that is, to they know not whom, nor when; contrary to ſo old, and generall a Tradition.</p>
               <p>This deſtructive Divinity, which hath been ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently broached in this All-reforming Age, will not be found altogether ſo good in the Iſſue; it is not ſafe tempering with the maine Grounds of our Religion; If we deny, or doubt of the <hi>Infallible Authority</hi> of the Creed, (as we doe, if we deny that it had infallible Authors) what will become of Chriſtianity? <hi>If the Foundations be destroyed, what can the Righteous doe? Pſ.</hi> 11. 3. The profeſſion of our Beliefe is that which makes us Believers, and ranks us in the number of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

               <p>Leave men once to the bare letter of Scripture, (which being large, and made up of ſeverall pieces, whereof all were not generally received till the end of the fourth Century, &amp; ſince that by reaſon of its dark, and ambiguous expreſſions, and not a few ſeeming contradictions, hath been found unhapily abnoxious to the weaknes and malice of erroneus interpreters) by taking a way the Creeds, which as they are more
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119760:91"/> ſhort ſo they are more cleare and plaine Summaries of the Chriſtian Faith; together with the conſentient judgment of Antiquity; which hath acknowledged and eſtabliſhed them, and delivered them over to us: And then with out the ſpirit of prophecy, we may ſoone foretell what will become of Religion: Then what with <hi>Marcionis Machaera,</hi> and <hi>Valentini Stilus</hi> (to uſe the words of <hi>Tertullian</hi>), What with chopping off whole Bookes at a blow, yea an whole Teſtament, With the Anabaptiſt; what with razing out whole chapters, and verſes, ſcraping out words and letters, altering of points and comma's; What with wreſting and torturing the poore remainder, untill it ſpeakes the tormenters mind (which hath been the deſperate Project, and Practiſe of <hi>Hereticks</hi> in all Ages) a very ſmall portion of our Religion will be left entire, yea, no meanes will be at all left to convince many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, or to ſatisfy <hi>Pilats</hi> ſo neceſſary queſtion <hi>What is Truth?

               <p>This made <hi>Tertullian</hi> bold to ſay, <hi>Non provocandum eſt ad Scripturas, nec in his conſtituendum certamen, in quibus aut nulla, aut incerta victoria eſt, aut parum certa.

                  </gap>, that is <hi>Publick Admoniton;</hi> or Reprehenſion, for they who are ſo in love with their new opinions, as not to yeeld unto the Authority of the Church, will les yeeld unto the force of Arguments; which are eaſily illuded, or evaded by the ſubtilty of Hereticks, who will fly to any ſhifts, rather then acknowledge a victory; and looke upon their ſuperiors as their equals, when they ſee them thus deſcende into the ranke of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, whom they can Combat with upon even Ground.</p>
               <p>Now, that which hath cauſed ſome latter <hi>Proteſtant Divines</hi> to call in queſtion, or deny the aſſigned <hi>Authors</hi> of the Creed, is this, as far as I can conjecture; that the Creed comes to us under the name of a <hi>Tradition,</hi> and they are loath to acknowledge any ſuch for Divine or Apoſtolicall, leaſt Popery ſhould breake in at this Gap; and therefore they think it ſafeſt to adhere only to the word written.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould this ſo much fright us? For the queſtion betweene the Church of Rome, and the Reformed, is not (as I conceive) whether there be any certeine Tradition, and conſequently to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? But what traditions are certeine and allowable?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119760:92"/> For have we not received the Scripture it ſelfe by Tradition, <hi>viz.</hi> The number, Authors, and authority of the Canonicall Bokes? Whence have we the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Infants but by Tradition? (For though we have a faire plea for it upon Scripture-Grounds, yet we have neither cleare precept, nor precedent for it, that hath hithertoo been ſhewen) or, the ſetting a part of the Lords Day and other Feſtivals for Gods publick Service? For we have no expreſſe command for the obſervation of theſe in holy writ, nor for many other Church ordinances that might be named.</p>
               <p>Our Church, indeed, juſtly blames the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> for obtruding upon us, and other Churches her owne Rituall Traditions, as of neceſſity to Salvation; ſome of which are uncertain; others frivolus, burthenous, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and even contrary to Gods word: ſo did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119760:94"/> thoſe ancient fabricks which our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers left us, building in their roome ſome ſlight, painted Toy, without either ſtrength or uſe; to pleaſe the fancy of the contriver, not ſatisfy the judgement, or conduce to the profit, of the ſober Chriſtian.

               <p>As for this preſent Argument; though the Reaſons which ſome have brought againſt it, ſeeme to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors more then probable, yet, I ſuppoſe, that upon due triall, they will appeare leſſe then neceſſary, ſo that they will prove unſufficient to overthrow the conſtant Tradition of ſo many Ages, and to ſway a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtreame of ſo maine a current, the joynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Teſtimony of ſo many Doctors of the Church, as well Moderne as Ancient. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet downe their Reaſons fully and faithfully, yea ſomewhat more diſtinctly than they have done; and then, ſubjoyne their Anſwers in ſeverall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Were the Creed compiled by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, it is not likely that S. <hi>Luke,</hi> writing the hiſtory of their Acts, would have omitted ſo principall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Sundry other things of farre leſſe conſequence he hath carefully recorded (as the Apoſtles Decree concerning Ceremonies, and things indifferent) but of this ſo important and weighty a buſineſſe (the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree concerning the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>) he makes not ſo much as one word mention, which certainly he would never have failed to doe, had they made any ſuch? At leaſt, if S. <hi>Luke</hi> had omitted it in the <hi>Acts,</hi> yet it cannot be conceived, how S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſhould not ſpeake a word of it in their <hi>Epiſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:119760:94"/>
               <p>I anſwer; Firſt, that this is but a negative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and concludeth not; S. <hi>Luke</hi> makes no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof in the <hi>Acts,</hi> therefore it was never done. To give a like inſtance, or two. S. <hi>Mathew</hi> undertakes to write the Hiſtory of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Life and Death, with the Precedents of the one, and the Conſequents of the others; and yet there be many weighty Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges omitted by him, which we find afterwards related by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> eſpecially, compoſed his Goſpell of thoſe particular Actions and Speeches of our Saviour, which were left unmentioned by the three former Evangeliſts: yet, he himſelfe tells us in the concluſion of his Book, that <hi>There were many other things which Ieſus did, the which if they ſhould be written eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one,</hi> he ſuppoſed, <hi>that even the World it ſelfe could not containe the Bookes that ſhould be written. Ioh.</hi> 21. 25.</p>
               <p>But to come cloſer yet to the Argument; S. <hi>Luke</hi> in that Booke of his, which is entituled <hi>The Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> mentions very few <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, yet hath large Digreſſions concerning S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and S. <hi>Philip,</hi> who were no <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but <hi>Deacons;</hi> Then, he proſecutes the ſtory of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Barnabas;</hi> but, more at large, that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe companion he was in his Apoſtolicall Peregrinations: and yet, how many materiall Paſſages, even touching S. <hi>Paul,</hi> doth he omit, ſome of which we find afterwards occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally recorded by himſelfe in his Epiſtles, eſpecially, in thoſe of his to the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Corinth?</hi> As for example, his Travailes into <hi>Arabia</hi> after his converſion, his Coming to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> three yeares after, and communicating his Goſpell with <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn; his withstanding Peter at Antioch,</hi> his <hi>rapture</hi> into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and unto the third Heaven;</hi> together with many other particulars: things, ſure, of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

               <p>If it be replyed; that this Argument is produced only as probable, and yet will hold good unleſſe ſome probable cauſe of the omiſſion can be aſſigned, why a poynt of ſo great importance, and ſo neceſſary is not mentioned, when others of leſſe weight are, and that the Evangeliſts omit indeed diverſe Things which Chriſt ſaid, and did, yet ſet downe all Things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, which was their main end.</p>
               <p>I rejoyne; That whoſoever goes about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw ſo old, and received a Tradition, may juſtly be required to bring more than probabilities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, if he expect to be believed; that this Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity grounded on S. <hi>Lukes</hi> omiſſion is ſufficiently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by the poſitive Teſtimonies of the Ancients which I haue produced to the Contrary; that the Compoſure of the Creed by the Apoſtles, was a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe confeſſedly of great importance, but the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of it by S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> was not altogether ſo neceſſary, it being enough that it was otherwiſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; that, laſtly S. <hi>Luke</hi> probably omitted it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a thing ſo vulgarly knowen in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, the Apoſtles delivering it to be kept, and uſed, whereſoever they Preached.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though S. <hi>Luke</hi> make no expreſſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Creed of the Apoſtles, yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> in diverſe of his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> not obſcurely alludes unto it, under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Formes, &amp; Phraſes of Speech as hath bin ſhewen at large before, ſo alſo doth S. <hi>Jude. v.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſets downe the Apoſtles Decree concerning the ceremoniall Law, becauſe it was the Reſult of a Generall Councell, and that Councell oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſiond
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119760:95"/> by a great Diſſention in the Church of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſent to the Apoſtles about the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this queſtion. Now, matters of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention are the chiefe Theme of Hiſtories; and that Councell, with the Proceedings and Formes thereof; is ſet downe on purpoſe, as a patterne to all ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages. As for the <hi>Creed,</hi> or <hi>Canon of Faith,</hi> there was no ſuch occaſion for the mentioning of it, ſeeing no Cavill then aroſe about it, nor any generall Councell concurred to the Compoſure of it, but only a private meeting of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Not one of the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> who lived within the <hi>three firſt Centuries,</hi> ſpake of any ſuch thing in any of their writings; and yet they ſhould beſt know it, whoſe Times were neareſt unto the Apoſtles. Then, of ſo many Church-hiſtorians, who ſtudiouſly gathered together the confeſſions of Synods and Anti-Synods, not one makes mention of this, though a matter of the greateſt conſequence, as being the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and mother of all following Confeſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, That the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> who lived within the <hi>three firſt Centuries,</hi> make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Creed</hi> and the Compoſure thereof by the Apoſtles; I appeale to the former Teſtimonies cited out of <hi>Irenaeus, Tertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> who all lived within <hi>two hundred yeers</hi> after our <hi>Saviours Aſſenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; Though we have not any Comments extant on the Creed, written by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>three firſt Centuries (Origen,</hi> excepted, who largely expounds it in his Bookes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) yet it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that more of them expounded it paraphraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>Ruffinus</hi> (who lived in the next Age) in the Preface to his Expoſition of the <hi>Creed,</hi> tels
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119760:96"/> us of thoſe before him, <hi>comperi</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nonnullos illustrium Tractatorum, aliqua de his pie, &amp; breviter edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſe,</hi> That ſome famous Authors had wrote piouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and briefly on this Subject. And, a litle after; <hi>Tentabimus, quae omiſſa videntur a prioribus, ad implere,</hi> That he would endevour to ſupply, what had been omitted by former Writers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it was the cuſtome of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Biſhops, to expound the <hi>Creed</hi> unto Catechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, when they came to <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> at thoſe two ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne times of the year <hi>Eaſter,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> as appears by thoſe Homilies or Catecheticall Sermons now extant, of <hi>Cyril, Chryſoſtome, Auſtin, Chryſollogus</hi> and others. many more (doubtles) there were framed by former Biſhops, which either were never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to paper, or, being then writen are now loſt. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> As to the ſilence of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians</hi> touching this ſubject, a little obſervation will informe us, that nouell, ſtrange, ſingular, Paſſages are the uſuall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of their Pens, not things Publick, knowne, and received, ſuch as the Creed is &amp; was common then in every Novices mouth. So the Romane Hiſtorians ſet not downe their lawes, cuſtomes, court-procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as things vulgarly known, and of daily practice amongſt them; the omiſſion whereof rendring their Hiſtories obſcure to ſtrangers, they are ſet downe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly by <hi>Dionyſius Halycarnaſſeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis ſufficient, that ſeverall Fathers in moſt Ages occaſionally make mention of it, when they had to deale with Hereticks, who denied or perverted it. But, that Ancient Church-Hiſtorians mention the ſeverall <hi>Confeſſions of Faith,</hi> which were framed in ſeverall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Anti-Synods (as <hi>Socrates,</hi> and others, in the buſineſſe of the <hi>Arian</hi> faction) hath this double Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer;</hi> 1. Some one word might poſſibly be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſucceeding Times, by way of explication, to diſtinguiſh the <hi>True Church</hi> from the <hi>Conventicles</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and yet not prejudice the Antiquity of the whole; So, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119760:97"/> explication only, not to ſupply a mutilous member or defective <hi>Article;</hi> but the Forme being now ſetled for ſo many hundred years ſuch liberty is taken away together with the cause of it, the full, and genuine ſence of the Creed having been abundanty delivered to the Church in ſucceeding <hi>Exegeticall Creeds,</hi> and expoſitions of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſo that there is now no need of coyning new words or Phraſes by way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But, Secondly, We have no need to make uſe of this ſuppoſall; for the word [<hi>Catholick</hi>] might very well be placed in the <hi>Creed</hi> from the Original compoſure of it. notwithſtanding whatſoever is produced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from the teſtimony of <hi>Pacianus.</hi> for this <hi>Pacianus (Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and contemporary to S. <hi>Jerome</hi>) in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Sympronianus</hi> the <hi>Novatian,</hi> which is entituled, <hi>De Catholico Nomine;</hi> after he had dealt with him very gently in the begining (ſuperſcribing his Epiſtle thus, <hi>Pacianus Symproniano Fratri</hi>) to winne him over the more effectually to the Communion of the Church; in the Body of his Epiſtle he uſeth theſe words, <hi>Sub Apoſtolis, inquies, nemo Catholicus vocabatur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eſto; ſic fuerit; vel illud indulge; cum poſt Apoſtolos haereſes extitiſſent diverſiſ<expan>

               <p>Firſt, That he mentions not at all the applying of the word [<hi>Catholick</hi>] to the <hi>Church,</hi> or whole Company of Believers as it is placed in the Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for this was not cal'd in queſtion by <hi>Sympronianus</hi>) but the aplying of it to particular perſons which in the Apoſtles times were called <hi>Diſciples,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:119760:97"/> not <hi>Catholicks;</hi> as <hi>Sympronianus</hi> objected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Pacianus</hi> abſolutely granteth not, that the word [<hi>Catholick</hi>] was not ſo uſed in the <hi>Apoſtles Times,</hi> but only, indulgeth ſo much unto his adverſary; becauſe, notwithſtanding this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall, he was otherwiſe able to convince him upon his own conceſſions; which kind of ſuppoſall or indulgence, is moſt uſuall amongſt Polemick writers, there by to winne over, and worke upon the Adverſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Reaſon of the name, brought by <hi>Pacianus,</hi> and urged upon <hi>Sympronian,</hi> namely, the diſtinguiſhing of the true Church, from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sects led by, &amp; denominated from, their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall factions, and Hereticall heads, is very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Apoſtles dayes and ſo required the like diſtinctive Epethete; for S. <hi>Paul</hi> blames the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> for <hi>Schiſmes</hi> and addicting themſelves factiouſly to ſeverall Idoliſed Teachers which they had choſen to themſelves; for though he names only <hi>Peter, Apollos,</hi> and himſelfe, yet his Diſcourſe cheifly aimes at ſome other Popular Preachers, and falſe Apoſtles, as appeares by comparing 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 20. And, S. <hi>John</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly names the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> (denominated from one <hi>Nicolas</hi>) in his <hi>Revel. ch. 2. v.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>As for S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> involving the word [<hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>] in the Epithet <hi>Holy;</hi> it proves not that it was not then in the Text of the Creed; for it was uſual with the Fathers in their Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall explications, to omit the expreſſion of ſeverall Particles, ſometimes one ſometimes another, which yet were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſedly in the <hi>Creed,</hi> &amp; are expreſly mentioned by them in their other Homilies, or Tractates, as wee
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119760:98"/> may ſee in <hi>Chryſollegus, Euſebius Gallicanus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Hereticks</hi> aroſe, not only after, but even in the very <hi>Apoſtles Times;</hi> the Tares were ſcattered preſently upon the ſowing of the Wheat, in the late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plowed field of the Church. S. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that <hi>Firſt-borne</hi> of the <hi>Devill,</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> as the <hi>Auncients</hi> Style him. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 9.—24. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us of <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Phyletus. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 17. And, of <hi>Alexander, Phygellus,</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes. 1 Tim. 1. 20. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. Yea, S. <hi>John</hi> informes us in more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Termes, That there were many <hi>Antichrists</hi> in the world, even whilſt he lived, who <hi>denyed the Father and the Sonne; 1 Io.</hi> 2. 18. 22. Theſe <hi>Antichriſts</hi> then were <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who taught contrary to the <hi>Faith of Chriſt</hi> wherefore, it is moſt probable, that the word [<hi>Catholick</hi>] was placed in the Creed, even by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the reaſon before aſſigned.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; The <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> might juſtly be ſtyled Catholick, or univerſall, to diſtinguiſh it from the Church of the Jewes, which was a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, confined (if not within the Bounds of one Country) yet unto one Nation; whereas the Chriſtian Church comprehended all Nations, and had no other Bounds than thoſe of the world; although not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the time of making the Creed, yet in vertue, and power; according to that generall Commiſſion of our <hi>Saviour</hi> to his <hi>Apoſtles, Goe, &amp; teach all Nations Mat.</hi> 28. 29. And gaine, <hi>Ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me, both in Jeruſalem, and all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermoſt part of the Earth, Act.</hi> 1. 8. The Jewes were ſo envious and proud, as not to receive the Gentiles into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or acknowledge them partakers in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> they would have had them all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119760:98"/> and submit to the Ceremonial Law; but God <hi>broke downe this Partition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wall, Eph.</hi> 2. 14. As he made appeare by the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Sheet</hi> which he ſent to S. <hi>Peter Act</hi> 10. 11. 15. And by the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem; Act.</hi> 15. And ſo gathered all into one <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Church Catholick</hi> ſo called in reſpect of Time, Place, Perſons, Faith; which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Common Faith. Tit.</hi> 1. 4. For this Reaſon at leaſt the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> might juſtly frame the <hi>Article</hi> at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt Compoſure, in theſe words <hi>I believe the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The different relation of the Story be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes the uncerteinty of it; for they give not all the ſame <hi>Article</hi> to the ſame <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> and ſome marſhall them one way, ſome another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt; Diverſity of opinions in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances not materiall cannot juſtly call the maine Point in doubt. So, all Chriſtians believe the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Mathew,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrwes,</hi> to be the Word of God, though Divines differ about the language in which, and the time when they were writen: and they all agree there is an <hi>Hell,</hi> though they doe not, about the place where. Therefore, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome ſlight, groundleſſe differences (ſome of them, of latter inconſiderable Authors) wee have no juſt reaſon to disbelieve the Apoſtles Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Creed.</p>
               <p>Secondly; As to the various marſhalling and order of the Articles; it cannot juſtly argue the uncerteinty of the Tradition; becauſe the Bookes of the holy Scripture are alſo placed in a various method, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto ſeverall Editions and Tranſlations; ſome following the order of the Hebrew Text, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches; others that of the Septuagint, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119760:99"/> the old Latine Tranſlation, as the Churches of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; Neither can the diverſe aſcribing of them to ſeverall Apoſtles, raiſe any juſt doubt of the Compoſers of the whole; for we find not a few <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies</hi> agitated amongſt Divines, concerning the <hi>Authors</hi> of ſeverall Bookes of Scipture: in the Old <hi>Teſtament,</hi> of the Bookes of the <hi>Judges, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> &amp; of the Booke of <hi>Job:</hi> in the New <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of the Second, and Third Epiſtle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> whether <hi>Iohn</hi> the Elder were the Author of theſe Epiſtles; and, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Divine of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> as diſtinct Perſons from <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt? Or, whether <hi>Iohn</hi> the Ap. were the Author of all three, under 3 ſeveral Titles? But more eſpecially the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrwes</hi> is queſtioned; whether it were <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Barnabas, Luke,</hi> or <hi>Clemens.</hi> And yet, not withſtanding all theſe Controverſies, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church now doubts not of the Authority of theſe Bookes; why ſhould we more doubt of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Creed,</hi> although we know not how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to aſſigne the Diſtinct Articles to their ſeverall Apoſtles; whenas in truth, the more probable opinion is, that they joyntly concurd to the framing of them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 5. If the Creed for matter, and forme were from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and they delivered it preciſely in thoſe words wherein we now have it, why is it not placed in the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> for if you ſay, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> (as S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and others tell us) we muſt know that thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> concerne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Goverment, and Rites of the Church; whereas the <hi>Creed</hi> is a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or Doctrine, required to be profeſt by Chriſtians at their Baptiſme.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:119760:99"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt; To retort a like queſtion: why is not the number of the <hi>Canonicall Bookes</hi> put into the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> that ſo we might the more certainly know, what Bookes are of <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> and what are <hi>Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious?</hi> This ſure is a Doctrinall Point, the maine Fundamentall one; and highly concernes our Faith if any thing doe; and yet it is derived unto us by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; why may not the Creed in like manner.</p>
               <p>Secondly; the <hi>Creed</hi> is taken out of the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> either in expreſſe words, or by evident, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequence (whereof the Apoſtles were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring <hi>Iudges</hi>) reduced only to a Method and ſet Forme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; The Apoſtles thought not fit to commit it unto writing, but delivered it by word of mouth to the Paſtours or Biſhops of the Churches, whom they left to ſucceed them; and who, in a continued Succeſſion downe from the Apoſtles, delivered the Creed unto us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; That unwritten Traditions comprehend not only matters of Practiſe (ſuch as are the Rites, &amp; Regiment of the Church) but alſo matter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; I appeale not only to the former inſtance of the Canon of Scripture, and to this of the Creed conſtantly witneſſed by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Ierome</hi> with many other Fathers, (whoſe teſtimony deſerves much credit) but to a Third alſo, the perpetual Virginity of the Mother of God; of which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Perkins</hi> (no friend of Romiſh Traditions) ſaith thus; <hi>That the Virgin Mary lived, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Virgin, is received for Truth, but yet not recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and, in Eccleſiaſtical Writers, many worthy ſayings of the Apoſtles and other holy Men are Recorded, and received of us for Truth, which nevertheleſſe are not ſet downe in the Bookes of the Old or New Testament; and, many things we hold
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:119760:100"/> for Truth, not written in the Word, if they be not againſt the Word.</hi> Thus he in his Reform. Cath. of Tradit. Concl. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The Creed hath not been preſerved ſo ſafe from Addition, Detraction, Mutation, as the reſt of the Scriptures alwayes have been; therefore, not likely to have come from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I could wiſh that the holy Scriptures had beene kept ſo ſafe, as the Objectour beares us in hand; the Church then would have been more pure, and more peaceble. But,</p>
               <p>Firſt; For Additions; Doth not our Church cut off thoſe Apocryphall pieces which were long a goe an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> next to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Hester?</hi> And doe we not find the 151 <hi>Pſalme</hi> added unto the reſt a Copy whereof we have in <hi>Sixti Sen. Bibliothecâ?</hi> And in the New <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> for ſome Ages, the Booke called <hi>Hermae Paſtor,</hi> was joyned to the Bookes we now have, and eſteemed by many for Canonicall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For Detraction; Have not whole bookes been taken a way by diverſe Hereticks, who would acknowledge no ſcripture that made againſt them? For Inſtance; <hi>Marcion</hi> acknowledged none of the four Goſpels, but only that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke;</hi> neither his, entirely; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> witneſſeth. Examples of other Hereticks are almoſt infinite. Yea which is more; ſome Canonicall Bookes for a while were denied, or (at leaſt) doubted of, and ſo left out in diverſe Copyes, by ſome Orthodox Doctors of the Church, till the Truth became afterwards better cleared, as the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of <hi>James,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iude,</hi> the Second Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Second, &amp; Third Epiſtles of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> &amp; the Revelation of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> For this we may conſult the Syriack Tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:119760:100"/>
               <p>Thirdly; For Mutation; The Hereticks of old time, who were bold to cut off whole Bookes, did much more boldly adventure on changing of verſes, wordes, letters, and points. The fraud of the Arians both old and new, is notorious in this kind.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe for all theſe ſubtile, and various De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Satan to overthrow Religion, and pervert the Word of Truth by theſe his miſchievous Inſtruments, yet ſome ancient copies both of the Scripture &amp; Creed, by Gods eſpeciall Providence have been kept en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, whereby the reſt might be examined and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Although the Creed hath ever been much eſteemed in the Church, yet was it never accounted Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>icall: The Ancient Doctors were ſo far from equalling it with Scripture, that they appealed from it thereunto as to an higher Authority; ſo did <hi>Cyr. Catech.</hi> 4. And <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> in his Booke againſt <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius Bib. Pat. Tom.</hi> 9. Which without queſtion they never would have done had they thought, it had bin from the Apoſtles, in ſuch Forme, and as now wee have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt; Whether the Creed were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Authority, Canonicall, that is Divine, and unqueſtionable; and, for Frame, Apoſtolicall; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to all thoſe Ancient Fathers, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced; amongſt whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> (one very Ancient expreſly tels us, that the <hi>Creed was ordained by Chriſt</hi> viz. by the Miniſtery of his Apoſtles, who were Authoriſed by him, and aſſiſted by his Spirit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; according to that ſaying of his <hi>He that heareth you heareth me. Luk.</hi> 10. 16. Whence he ſends the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to the Churches founded by the Apoſtles, to find this Doctrine or Rule of Faith, there left by them.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119760:101"/> 
                  <hi>De praeſc. adv. haer. cap.</hi> 21. Withall, he cals it The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> or <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had done before him; and tels us, that no part thereof may be cald in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>Seconly; 'Tis not unlikly that ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may cite places of Scripture in confirmation of the Creed, as the Apoſtles themſelves in their writings bring forth places out of the old Teaſtament to back and vindicate the truth of what they ſaid; yea, our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelfe oft cites <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; the Prophets and authorizeth his doctrine by their Teſtimony, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Auditours to <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (of the old Teſtament) <hi>for they are they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which Teſtify of me Io.</hi> 5. 39. See alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 22. 2 Pet. 1. 19. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2, 14, 23. And it is the uſuall practiſe of our preachers at this day to bring proofes for their textuall obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (though oft expreſſe wordes of Scripture) out of other paralell Places. But, as well thoſe citations of the Fathers, as theſe of our Bleſſed Sauiour, and his Apoſtles, are brought, not ſo much to confirme the truth of what they ſaid, as to ſatisfy the mindes of their Auditours, which were more fully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they they ſaw the joynt correſpondence of the Creed with the Scripture, and the Goſpell with the Law. And, we find at this day, though divine Authority doe abundantly ſuffice to confirme us in the Grounds of our Religion; yet it doth more fully content the judgment of the Learned when they ſee the probates of Reaſon to conſpire with the dictates of Faith; for Inſtance, in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Godhead,</hi> and the <hi>immortality of the Soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; As for the two Fathers, whom the objectour cites, I ſhall returne a more particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:119760:101"/>
               <p>Firſt; <hi>Cyril,</hi> indeed, in that place tels us that the myſteries of the Faith ought not to be delivered unto the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> ſimply &amp; nakedly, but as clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with ſcripture; and, that they ſhould not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply believe him, unleſſe he brought proofes from thence for what he delivered; becauſe the ſafety of our Faith (ſaith he) depends not on the pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Rhetorick, but on the demonſtration of Gods Word written: The reaſon whereof he aſſignes in the begining of the ſame Homily, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c. The Diſciples of the Hereticks by their elegancy of ſpeech and fair, ſoothing tongues, under the name of Chriſtians, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the hearts of the ſimple; they hide the poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>usdartes of their ungodly Doctrines with ſugred expreſſions, of all whom joyntly our Lord ſaith, <hi>beware leaſt any man deceive you,</hi> then he goes on, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for this cauſe the doctrine of Faith is delivered with expoſitions thereon. So that he would not have the Creed or himſelfe believed without Scripture; not that the Creed, but the Times, required ſuch proofe: for the Heretickes of thoſe Dayes, partly framed new <hi>Creeds</hi> of their own; partly, added to, altered, and perverted the old, withall, indeavouring to make their doctrine good by ſeeming probabillities of Reaſon, and flouriſhes of Rhetorick. It was neceſſary therefore, in this caſe, to diſcover theſe falſe Creeds, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, by bringing all unto the Text of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly; The other Father <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> in the begining of his Booke <hi>De Spiritu Sancto,</hi> written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Macedonius,</hi> taxeth a falſe reading of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119760:102"/> Creed, crept into it through the ignorance of ſome Tranſcribers, who wrote <hi>I believe in the holy Church</hi> for <hi>I believe the holy Church:</hi> &amp;, by this error enervated an Argument uſually alleadged by the Fathers for the Deity of the holy Ghoſt, againſt <hi>Macedonius</hi> and his Followers: <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> therefore proves by certeine Places of Scripture that they are commanded to believe in God alone, but never in man; wherefore ſeeing the Church conſiſts of a company of men, that reading of the Creed muſt conſequently be falſe, which enjoynes us to believe in the Church. But what of all this? He appealed not, in this, from the Creed unto Scripture, but by Scripture corrects a falſe reading of the Creed; as the Fathers, in their polemicall writings againſt Hereticks, frequently correct their corrupt quotations of ſome places of Scripture by other undoubted places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The Reaſon aſſigned, why the Apoſtles compoſed this Creed diſcovers the vanity of the Tradition; what was that? That it might be (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) to the <hi>Apostles</hi> a Canon or Rule, according to which they ſhould ſquare, and conforme their Preaching; what, to the Apoſtles, to whom Chriſt promiſed his Bleſſed Spirit that ſhould lead them into all Truth? Certeinly, they, needed it not for their owne ſakes, amongſt whom there was no ground of difference, nor doubt of the Principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. And, whereas others more probably ſay it was framed for the Churches ſake, that ſhee might have a ſhort, plaine, yet full confeſſion of Faith, as a <hi>Formula</hi> of Beliefe, to be publickly recited at the Time of Baptiſme; neither will this hold; for in the Apoſtles Age, the Confeſſion of Faith was plaine and ſimple when they came to be Baptized, namely, in Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119760:102"/> or, in the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; as appeares by the Hiſtory of the Acts; ſo that the Church had then no need of ſuch a <hi>Formula.</hi> It began not to be required, till diverſe Hereſies brake into the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt; It is readily confeſt, that the Apoſtles needed no Rule of Faith whereby to ſquare their Preaching, as if otherwiſe they ſhould have erred; yet they might well agree one a Canon, or Rule of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, wherewith they thought fit to acquaint all Chriſtians, as with Points neceſſary to Salvation; whereas otherwiſe, they might have Preached more at large, and intermixt matters of leſſer Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>As for the Authors who bring the Reaſon alleaged in the objection, they lay it downe, not in theſe Termes, leaſt the Apoſtles being ſeperated each from other, <hi>ipſi inter ſe in varias ſcinderentur partes:</hi> much leſſe, thus, <hi>ne ſubinde alii abaliis in doctrinâ abirent,</hi> as is odiouſly alleaged. but <hi>Ruffinus</hi> renders the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus <hi>Ne diverſum aliquid his, qui ad fidem Chriſti invitabantur, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerent,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in like words, <hi>Ne diverſum vel diſſonum praedicarent his qui ad fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſti invitabantur.</hi> Now <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi> and <hi>abverſum, diſſonum</hi> and <hi>abſonum</hi> are two things. there was no feare that the Apoſtles by being ſevered each from other, ſhould Preach ought contrary to the Truth, or to one Another, if they had not before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed uppon a Forme: yet, they might have Preached ſomewhat diverſe from the Fundamentalls of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, namely, other Points of inferiour concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or at leaſt, the ſame in other wordes, if they had not agreed on this Rule at their ſetting forth; whence their Auditours might have taken occaſion to ſuſpect and argue them of falſehood (not believing they were all guided by the ſame Spirit) or to part them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119760:103"/> into factions, as it fell out in the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth about <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> although they taught the ſame Goſpell. And, what ſtirres aroſe in the Church about a Ceremony <hi>viz.</hi> the time of obſerving <hi>Easter,</hi> derived fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a different tradition of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt of the Chriſtian world, (though they all agreed in the main, the keeping of the Feaſt) <hi>Euſebius,</hi> &amp; others will ſufficienly informe us.</p>
               <p>But, to come cloſer to our Subject. A notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the very ſame kind, namely, in matter of of Doctrin (ſuch as the Creed is) we find in the Greek and Latine Church about the middle of the fourth Century, touching the Grand myſtery of the Trinity; which yet upon due examination, proved only a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the tongue &amp; language. The Controverſie is thus ſet down by <hi>Greg. Naz Orat.</hi> 21. written in praiſe of the Great <hi>Athanaſius Num.</hi> 46. 47. The <hi>Orientals,</hi> ſaith he held one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and three Hypoſtaſes, or or ſubſiſtences. The Latines by Reaſon of the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Tongue, and the narrowneſſe of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, could not diſtinguiſh Hypoſtaſis from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence from Eſſence; &amp; therefore inſteed of Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis brought in the new-coind word <hi>Perſona [Gr.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] to ſignify the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive Relations of the Three, as <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The effect deſerved laughter, or rather Lamentation; this ſmall difference of wordes, ſeemed a diverſity of Beliefe, for the Orientals ſuſpected the Weſtrne Church of Sabilianiſme becauſe they would not acknowledge three Hypoſtaſes, but caled them by the name of three Perſons. And, the Weſtern Church ſuſpected the Orientals of Arianiſme, for holding three
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119760:103"/> Hypoſtaſes. contentions dayly growing hotter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, had like to have ſeperated the Eaſt and Weſt about a ſyllabicall difference; But <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> ſaith he, with much patience and prudence, calling unto him, and hearing both Parties, having examined their meaning, and the ſenſe of the words, when he found them agreeing in the thing ſignifyed and at no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the doctrine it ſelfe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, granting them the diverſity of their Termes, he unites them together in the ſame Truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Though we hold it moſt certaine, that the Apoſtles, conſidered ſingle and apart, delivered nothing to the Church, either by word or writing, but what they were ſpecially aſſiſted in by the holy Ghoſt; and therefore moſt undoubtedly true; yet, for ought I know, as the holy Ghoſt revealed not all truths to the Apoſtles at once (no not when he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on them at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt) but delayed the manifeſting of ſome till afterwards, as for example the <hi>Converſion of the Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Peter in the viſion of the ſheet Act.</hi> 10. So he might not reveale ſome truthes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, when they were ſingle and apart, but only, when they met and conſulted together; For though every one of them by himſelfe was infallible in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Points, that is, ſo as to deliver nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Faith or Truth of Chriſtian Religion; yet without any Derogation to his priviledge, they might need the more eſpeciall aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt upon their Aſſembly, to inſtruct them which Points of Faith were neceſſary to Salvation, which not.</p>
               <p>We have a famous Inſtance of this recorded, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. For, when there aroſe a great queſtion in the Church
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119760:104"/> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whether the Gentiles newly converted in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> ſhould be circumciſed, and obey the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſent unto Jeruſalem about it. v. 2. that the Apoſtles, and Elders came together to conſider of this matter v. 6. What needed this conſidering in a ſolemne meeting, if they had been aſcertained what to reſolve before they met? It followes v. 7. That there was much diſputing, or debate in the Councell. Why not, even among the Apoſtles themſelves, who were the chiefe members thereof? At leaſt this diſputing might have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or cut ſhort by the Apoſtles, as a thing unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if it had not beene thought a good, and needfull Preamble unto a finall Deciſion. If the Church had conceived S. Peter, or any other of the Apoſtles, an infallible Judge in this Point, with out due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and the speciall aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt in a Synod, they might have ſpared both their meeting, and diſpute. But when there had been much diſputing and not before, they joyntly determined what Lawes to free them from, and what to impoſe upon them, as things neceſſary to be obſerved, v. 28. Namly the abſtaining from Bloud, and (conſequently) things ſtrangled. v. 29. According to that primitive law, given to the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Noah. Ge.</hi> 9. 4. (a Law ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Greek Church, by the <hi>Moſcontieth,</hi> &amp; their neighbour churches of <hi>Pola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> which have admitted the Reformation; and long obſerved generally by the whole Weſtern Church, even til the Times of <hi>Ludovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Pius</hi> as appeares by his, and his Father <hi>Charles</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitular) together with the <hi>abſtaining from Fornication, and things offered to Idols</hi> which the Apoſtle makes a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Idolatry 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 19, 20, 21. And are more clearly againſt the Morall Law, though not ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119760:104"/> by the generality of the Gentiles. Then, and not before, they uſe that ſtile, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us;</hi> that is, <hi>To us,</hi> in the Plurall, <hi>to us,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together.</p>
               <p>Conſonantly to this, S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us more plainly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 2. that long after his converſion, and calling unto his Apoſtleſhip, he went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and communicated the Goſpell which he Preached among the Gentiles, unto the Apoſtles who there reſided, namely, to <hi>Iames, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this for a Reaſon, leaſt (ſaith he) <hi>by any meanes I ſhould run, or had run in vaine, Gal.</hi> 2. 2. Now, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the <hi>Creed,</hi> wherein were to be compriſed the maine Grounds of Chriſtian Religion, was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the higheſt conſequence; and ſo, might very well require the joynt and ſerious deliberation of the Twelve, together with the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> To the Reply againſt the ſecond Reaſon; I Anſwer, That 'tis a groundleſſe ſuppoſall, to think that the Perſons to be Baptized in the Apoſtles times, were required to believe only in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> or in the Trinity alone: for,</p>
               <p>Firſt, we find other Principles of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine diſtinctly ſet downe, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. And Preached by the Apoſtles, before they Baptized their Auditors: for inſtance; the Article of <hi>Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sinnes,</hi> by <hi>Peter. Act.</hi> 10. 43. And by <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 13. 38, 39. The Article of the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> by the ſame <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for beliefe in <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles indeed required it as the maine poynt, as we read in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Eunuch, Act.</hi> 18. 37. and, of the <hi>Jaylor. Act.</hi> 16. 31. Yet not as the ſole poynt; for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119760:105"/> beliefe in the holy Ghoſt was alſo required as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the hiſtory of the Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus Act.</hi> 19. 2, 3, 6. 'Tis mentioned therefore as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, and that which virtually includes all the reſt; for to believe in Jeſus Chriſt as wee ought, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctrine which he taught &amp; revealed unto the world from the Father, as the guide or light to true Bleſſedneſſe; now, what was this, but the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Salvation, whereof the Creed for mater of Doctrinalls, is the Epitome, conſult to this purpoſe <hi>Io.</hi> 17. 3. And <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 13. 36.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As for beliefe in the moſt Holy Trinity it gives us more ſcope, as that which comprehends all the Articles of our Faith: for, as to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, implicitely conteines all the myſteries of our Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> His Godhead, Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Birth, Paſſion, Buriall, Deſcent into Hell, Reſurrection, Aſſenſion, Sitting on the right hand of the Father, and ſecond comming to Judgment, ſo, to believe in God the Father conteines his workes of Creation and Providence, which are the Viſible effects of his eternall Power and Godhead <hi>Ro.</hi> 1. 20. And to believe in the holy Ghoſt involves the whole worke of Sanctification, the applying of Chriſts Benefits to his Church, and compleating the Salvation of mankind, which are diſtinctly ſet downe in the foure laſt Articles. And, this S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> teacheth us in his firſt homily on the Creed already cited; where his Text ends thus <hi>I believe in the holy Ghost:</hi> but in his explication, he thus unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels the Article, and layes it open to view in its full extent—<hi>who brings us to the holy Church, ſhe remiteth our ſinnes, promiſeth the Reſurrection of the Body, and life everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:119760:105"/>
               <p>This beliefe therefore in Chriſt or in the Trinity is not to be nakedly &amp; ſimply underſtood, as if no other Particulars were required, but with relation to thoſe other Articles of the Creed, which in them lye hid, &amp; imboſomed; for the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Paſſages at large (eſpecially ſuch as were ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily knowne and practiſed, as the profeſſion of the Creed at Baptiſme) but briefly toucheth the heads of things. the Evangiliſts doe the like in relation of ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; miracles of our Saviour; ſo that we are faine to compare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together, to find out the ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and make up the Relation entire. To proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this point a little farther, and illuſtrate it by the like Inſtance. As the Apoſtles are ſaid to require <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> (and nought elſe mentioned) of the Perſons who came to be Baptized; ſo are they ſaid, (and that oftner) to <hi>Baptize in the name of Christ,</hi> without naming any other Perſon of the Trinity <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 41. And 10. 48. And 19. 5. And, yet we cannot imagine, that they omitted the mention of the other two Perſons. Firſt, becauſe it was Chriſts expreſſe command, that they ſhould <hi>Baptize all Nations in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt; Mat.</hi> 28. 19. Secondly; becauſe the Chriſtian Church hath alwayes held, that as water is the Eſſentiall matter, ſo this compoſure of words is the eſſentiall Forme of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; and ſo at no hand to be omitted. Wherefore, when the buſineſſe of rebaptization was agitated in the <hi>Nicene Councell</hi> it was determined thus; That the Perſons Baptized with the formentioned Catholick fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould not be rebaptized, as being rightly initiated into the Church, though by an hereticall hand; but as for the <hi>Pauliani,</hi> the Diſciples of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> who denyed the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and therefore Baptized in a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119760:106"/> wrong Forme; their Baptiſme was pronounced null and invalid; &amp; thoſe who were ſo illegally initiated, were received by a new Baptiſme into te Catholick Church. Let us ſay then with that moſt ancient Father <hi>Irenaeus, In Chriſti nomine ſubauditur, qui unxit, &amp; ipſe qui unctus eſt, &amp; ipſa unctio qua unctus eſt: &amp; unxit quidem Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unctus eſt vero Filius, in ſpiritu qui eſt unctio.</hi> that is <hi>In</hi> the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Chriſt is to be underſtood, the Anointer the Anointed, and the unction wherewith he was Anointed: now, he who Anointed is the Father, the Perſon Annointed is the Sonne with the Spirit who is the unction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, That the Church had need of ſuch a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula</hi> of Beliefe, will appeare, both by the Reaſon mentioned in the objection, for Hereſies infeſted the Church from the begining, to diſcover which, ſuch a <hi>Shibboleth</hi> was neceſſary: and if thoſe Hereſies had not ſprung up ſo early, yet ſuch a <hi>Symbole</hi> was as neceſſary at firſt for prevention, as afterwards for Triall. But of this, more in the next chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 9<hi rend="sup">h</hi> S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith <hi>Verba Symboli per Scripturas ſparſa ſunt, &amp; inde collecta, &amp; ad unum reducta.</hi> That the words of the Creed lye diſperſt in the Scriptures, from whence they are gathered, and reduced into a Forme. <hi>De Symb. Catech. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 1. So likwiſe <hi>Paſchaſius.</hi> If ſo, how can the Apoſtles be the Authors thereof? For out of the Old Teſtament they could not gather, that Chriſt was borne of the Virgin Mary; or That he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> And as for the new; many of the Apoſtles were dead before all was written; and <hi>James,</hi> before any was written.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt; The Old Teſtament may well be ſaid to conteine the whole Creed, if not expreſly, and in the hiſtory; yet typically and in the Prophecy. To inſtance in thoſe two Articles mentiond in the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119760:106"/> to wit, our <hi>Saviours Birth,</hi> and <hi>Paſsion.</hi> Doth not the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſay, <hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive and bare a Sonne? chap.</hi> 7. 14. Yea, in the preſent; <hi>Vnto us a Child is borne? chap.</hi> 9. 6. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> touching his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> doth not the ſame Prophet tel us, <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities, he is brought as a Lambe to the ſlaughter, he was cut off the land of the living? chap.</hi> 53. 5, 7, 8. And <hi>King David,</hi> in his perſon, <hi>They pierced my hands, and my feet Pſal. 22. 16. comp. Zach.</hi> 12. 10. As for the names of the Virgin, and the Judge, they are no ſuch conſiderable Additions, as to make a new, or another Article; ſo much may well be borrowed from the hiſtory of the Goſpell, &amp; yet the Article not improperly ſayd to be extant in the Prophecy.</p>
               <p>Secondly; The Death of <hi>Iames,</hi> mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 1, 2. Is placed by Chronologers in the yeare 44. After our Saviours Birth. But the writing of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes Goſpell</hi> (a Booke ſufficient to ſupply all thoſe Articles, which are not expreſly conteined in the Old Teſtament) as placed by them in the yeare 41. And ſo, two or three yeers before the death of <hi>Iames.</hi> In the ſame yeere 44. <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Lorinus</hi> place the Diſperſion of the Apoſtles into their ſeverall provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the framing of the Creed, by joynt Conſent as a neceſſary Preparative thereunto; the diſperſion, cauſed by the perſecution of <hi>Herod;</hi> and the <hi>doore of Faith being now opened to the Gentiles</hi> as God himſelfe had informed them by the <hi>Viſion</hi> ſhewed to <hi>Peter,</hi> before he converted <hi>Cornelius. Act.</hi> 10. 11. and 15. 7. But, this is agreed on all Hands, that whether this diſperſion were ſooner (as Corn. a <hi>lap.</hi> placeth it. <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 37.) or latter, (as <hi>Appollonius</hi> cited by <hi>Euſebius. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 17.) that S. <hi>Mathew</hi> wrote his Goſpell before it, (and that in the Hebrew Tongue, the language of the Jewes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119760:107"/> amongſt whom, and for whoſe uſe he wrote it, as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Origen,</hi> and others witneſſe, though it were ſoon after tranſlated into Greek by <hi>Iames</hi> the Lords Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) for an Hebrew Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript thereof was carried by S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> into the <hi>Indies,</hi> and found there by <hi>Pantaenus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigens</hi> Maſter; as witneſſe <hi>Euſeb. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 9. &amp; <hi>Ier. de Scriptor: Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 36. in <hi>Pantaeno.</hi> And, another Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript thereof, was carried by <hi>Barnabas</hi> S. <hi>Pauls</hi> fellow-Apoſtle, unto the Gentiles whither he was ſent, which he uſed alwaies to carry about with him; and which was after found buried with him in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> (in the time of <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperour) lying upon his Breaſt, The ſame Authors alſo agree, that the Creed was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Apoſtles, a little before this generall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion. Therefore, when we are told, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients place the compoſing of the Creed in the next yeare after our Saviours Aſcenſion, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the writing of S. <hi>Mathewes</hi> Goſpell, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is much miſtaken. <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſay indeed, that the Apoſtles compoſed the Creed after our <hi>Saviours Aſcenſion,</hi> and after the <hi>Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> but how long after, they determine not. They agree it was compoſed before their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Diſperſion into the ſeverall quarters of the World; which happened not in S. <hi>Stephens</hi> Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for then they abode all at <hi>Ieruſalem, Acts</hi> 8. 1. nor, before the converſion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> by S. <hi>Peter. Act.</hi> 10. For the ſet time of Preaching the Goſpell to the Gentiles, and incorporating them into the Church, was not before revealed, as appears by the <hi>Series</hi> of the ſtory; now, this converſion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> is placed by <hi>Baronius.</hi> A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 41. the very ſame yeare, wherein S. <hi>Mathews</hi> Goſpell, according to him, was written. It
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119760:107"/> is moſt probable therefore, that this Diſperſion of the Apoſtles happened in that Perſecution of <hi>Herod,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Act.</hi> 12. for preſently after this, we find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſolemnely conſecrated, and ſent away from <hi>Antioch,</hi> by the holy Ghoſts command, for the performance of this great worke, the converſion of the Gentiles <hi>Ast.</hi> 13. 2, 3, 4. Whereas before, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell was Preached unto the Jewes only, or (at the moſt) unto the <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> who were Jewes by Nation, or Religion (that is, Jewiſh Proſelites) at leaſt, though they ſpeake the language of the Grecians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they lived. This appears <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 19, 20. And to this accord the words of S. <hi>Chryſoſtome; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtoli praedicaverunt Iudaeis, longo<expan>
                        <am>

Mat. cap.</hi> 22. Compare herewith <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 8. &amp; chap. 13. 46, 47.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> meaning in thoſe words, may well be thus conſtrued. The <hi>Articles of the Creed lye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſt in the Scriptures of both Teſtaments</hi> (which, in his Time, were fully and compleatly extant) <hi>and were collected from thence;</hi> That is, partly, from the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> then written: partly, from the <hi>Hiſtory of the New,</hi> which the Apoſtles were eye and eare-witneſſes of, and ſhortly after committed to writing. Otherwiſe, we muſt make him palpably to contradict himſelfe; for elſewhere, he more then once affirmes, that the Twelve Apoſtles compoſed the Creed which now bears their name, and which he there explaines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. If the Creed were compoſed by the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119760:108"/> Apoſtles, latter Ages, out of reſpect unto them, would not have added ought unto it, as we ſee they did in the Creeds of <hi>Nice, Chalcedon,</hi> and that of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> for the Church of Rome was very ſlow to adde one particle unto the <hi>Constantinopolitan Creed (viz. Filio<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>
                  </hi>) thereby to ſignify the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son, as well as the Father, though fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Truth thereof; ſo greatly did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thoſe 150 Biſhops who compoſed it, although they had made ſome Canons in prejudice of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Dignity not only of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> but of the <hi>Roman See.</hi> Sure ſucceeding Ages owed far more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Succeeding Ages added nothing to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed but only explained ſome Articles, which by reaſon of their briefneſſe, or obſcurity, had been perverted by hereticall Gloſſes. Now, this was no diſreſpect, but in honour of the Apoſtles, thus to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their Creed from falſe Interpretations, and ſo reſtore it to its primitive Luſtre, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
               <p>Secondly; The <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Creed,</hi> Framed by thoſe 150 Fathers of the Eaſterne Church, had been confirmed by the Church of Rome, in the Synod under <hi>Damaſus;</hi> no marvaile then, if they were not over forward to adde the Particle [<hi>Filio<expan>

                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>
                  </hi>] without their conſents who were the prime Framers of that Creed, leaſt by ſo doing, they ſhould ſeeme to vary as well from themſelves, as the Fathers of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
               <p>Howſoever then that Councell might exalt the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Patriarch</hi> (now ſeated in the Head City of the Empire) to the ſeeming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet in matter of Faith
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119760:108"/> (ſuch as the Creed) there was no diſagreement at all, and ſo no ground of Alteration.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed; That to charge the <hi>Creed</hi> (writen for the capacity of the meaneſt) with obſcurity, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard; that, to inſert ought or adde to it, though, by way of explication, would be thought great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; that, to think they would adde any thing to it, who would not endure that of [<hi>filio<expan>

                     </expan>
                  </hi>] to be put into a Creed of humane Compoſure, &amp; when they agreed in the matter, is hardly credible. Beſides that ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages have added to the Creed in ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, is apparent in the <hi>Nicene;</hi> and, if thoſe additions be only explications, yet to joyne them with the other Articles, and to urge them as neceſſary, accounting all thoſe Heretickes who receive them not, is all one as to make new Articles, or fundamentall Truthes; and withall, it ſecretly taxeth the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> of inſufficiency, and obſcurity without thoſe Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>I rejoyne, Firſt, That the Creed in it ſelfe is plaine for the capacity of the meaneſt, yet the briefnes, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, &amp; indefinitenes of ſome Articles, hath laid it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to variety of Gloſſes, and thoſe oft Hereticall; which hath forced the Church to deliver the true meaning thereof by exegeticall Additions.</p>
               <p>Seconly; As for theſe explicatory Particles, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fecht them, not from their owne Braines but from Apoſtolicall Tradition, Conſerved in the Church from hand to hand, and atteſted by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of precedent Biſhops, to whom the Apoſtles both delivered the wordes of the Creed and the true ſence of each Article: and hence it is that they urged, and impoſed their explications on the Church, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed. Neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:119760:109"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Is the Apoſtles Creed hereby argued of Inſufficiency, or obſcurity; ſeeing nothing is added to it, as if it were Defective in it ſelfe; or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaind as if it were of it ſelfe obſcure. 'Tis only vindicated, by this meanes from corrupt Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and reſtored to its primitive ſenſe, and meaning; ſo the Scripture in like manner, though cleare in all neceſſary Points, and more copious by far than the Creed yet hath been abuſed in all Ages by curious, and Daring Heads; whence, ſo many large comments on it, for remedy to this miſchiefe; and we ſee dayly, that lawes though as clearly framed as may be, yet ſtand in need of Gloſſes, and Additionall Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when abuſed by reaſon of their Generality.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, As to the addition of the Particle [<hi>Filio<expan>

                  </hi>] it is not of the ſame Nature; becauſe it was annext to the Creed contrary to the Decree of the third Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell, contrary to the mind and open prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Greeke Church, which had framed that Creed at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and, by on part of the Church only, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>See of Rome,</hi> &amp; her adherents in the weſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 11<hi rend="sup">h</hi>. If after Ages were forced, by new ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcent Hereſies, to adde ſomething unto the <hi>Apoſtles Creed;</hi> yet ſure if they had thought it to be theirs, they would never have taken ought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, for this had been a ready courſe to make way for new Hereſies; wheras we find ſeverall Articles of the Creed omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them in their new-framed <hi>Symboles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Councels, and Fathers, which have delivered unto us new <hi>Symboles,</hi> or Confeſſions of Faith, occaſioned by emergent Hereſies; or rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the old Creed in ſome particulars, which were queſtion'd, or denied by the Hereticks of thoſe times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have taken nothing from the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> as in it ſelfe ſuperfluous; but have, in a larger Declaration,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119760:109"/> inſiſted on ſome Articles which were controverted by the ſaid Hereticks; omitting others, about which there was no doubt or queſtion raiſed, and therefore not neceſſary, in that caſe, to be repeated.</p>
               <p>The truth of this will more clearely appeare by the Paraphraſes of ſome Fathers on the Apoſtles Creed, who frequently omit ſome Articles, or parcells of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, in their explications, even in that Age, when 'tis confeſt on all Hands, that the <hi>Creed,</hi> which is now called the <hi>Apostles,</hi> was fully and compleatly extant. And, if they omitted ſome conſiderable Parts of the <hi>Creed,</hi> when they undertook profeſſedly to explain it (becauſe, either ſo plain, that they needed no explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, becauſe handled before in ſome other Homily or Paraphraſe) we may ſuppoſe, with greater Reaſon, that the Councels and Fathers omitted ſome one, or few Articles, in the compoſing of their new <hi>Symboles</hi> (which were framed upon ſome eſpeciall occaſion, &amp; directed againſt a particular Hereſy) though the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed</hi> were then fully extant.</p>

                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> If the Creed had been Compoſed by the Apoſtles with the ſame ſentences, words, &amp; order, which we now have, and had been ſo delivered to the Catholick Church; there had not been divers Creeds about the yeere 400, according to diverſe Churches; diverſe in the manner of expreſſion, and diverſe in the number of ſentences; which diverſity will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to him that ſhall compare ſeverall Creeds together, eſpecially the <hi>Nicene,</hi> which hath not a few ſentences added, &amp; others alterd, with which additions and alterations it was afterwards received, and uſed in the <hi>Eaſtern Churches,</hi> the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> being in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Firſt;</hi> The diverſity of ſeverall Creeds in ſome few words, or in the manner of expreſſion, is a Circumſtance not materiall, ſo the ſame ſenſe be kept inviolate, and all the Heads, or Articles of the Faith preſerved entire.</p>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:119760:111"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> The Church upon occaſion, hath added ſome Explicatory Particles to ſeverall Heads of the Creed, eſpecially in the two firſt Synods of Nice, and Conſtantinople; partly to vindicate the Faith from the corrupt Gloſſes of Hereticks; partly, the more fully to inſtruct her Children in the myſteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: But all theſe exegeticall Additions referre to ſome Article, or Limbe of this Body of Faith, like Phyſick or nouriſhiment to the part; but make not any new Article, thereby to render the Body mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous. The Fathers in thoſe two Synods, did neither on the one ſide, diſlocate or deprave any limbe of the Creed; nor, on the other ſide, ſupplyed any defective member; they only gaue a new growth or Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Burniſhing to ſome Articles; or reſtored that naturall vigour, and vitall juce unto ſome parts, which the Hereticks had deprived them off.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> that is, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by this meanes become vegete and growen, was afterwards uſed in the <hi>Greeke Church;</hi> yet not preſently, either that alone, or Principally, but only once in the year: afterward indeed, in the time of <hi>Timotheus</hi> Patriarch of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, (which was about ſix-ſcore yeers after its firſt compoſure) it was ordained to be uſed every <hi>Sunday.</hi> But before this, we may well preſume that the Apoſtles Creed was uſed in their Litturgies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe explications, except it can be ſhewen, that for foure hundered yeeres and upward, they either uſed no Creed in their Church-ſervice ordinarily, which is moſt improbable; or, that they uſed ſome other Creed, which no man yet hath demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</p>

               <p>To demonſtrate this more fully, and diſtinctly, it will not be unworthy our labour, to compare ſome Creeds together, in which Collation we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, with no ſmall delight and ſatisfaction, The conſent of Antiquity in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> the great care of the Church in preſerving that <hi>Faith</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and the growing Perfection of our ſacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according as ſhee grew in yeares.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. That Creed which was neithe made by the Apoſtles nor by any Generall Councell, nor was recieved by the <hi>Greeke</hi> or <hi>Eaſterne Churches,</hi> but in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and had beene ſo long recited, and uſed in the Church, now about the yeare 400, that then it was held an <hi>Apoſtolicall Tradition;</hi> which, it is certaine, was conveyed alſo by the Church of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119760:115"/> Rome, to other Churches of the Weſt, the Eaſterne Churches in the meane time uſing other Creeds; that Creed was compoſed by thoſe who had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Romane Church: but, there is nought of this which agreeth not to the <hi>Creed,</hi> that we call the Apoſtles; therefore, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> compoſed it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the ſummary Argument, uſed to diſprove the Authors of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and which we have already anſwered by Parts. For, that the <hi>Creed</hi> was compoſed by the Apoſtles, we have proved at large, both by Authorities and Arguments. That it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (for the full ſenſe and ſubſtance thereof) in the Greeke or Eaſterne Churche,, appears both by what we have before cited out of the Greeke Fathers, eſpecially <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the foreſaid Parallell of the <hi>Jeroſolymitan, Nicene, Antiochian,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian Creeds,</hi> with the <hi>Romane,</hi> and <hi>Aquileian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it was held an Apoſtolicall Tradition by the Church of Rome, before the yeare 400, appeares by the forecited Teſtimonies of the Laine Fathers, <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Ambroſe,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>That it was convaied by the Church of Rome to other Churches of the Weſt, which the Objector invidiouſly alleadgeth, to diſparage it amongſt the Reformed Churches) is more then hath been proved; but if it were, it maketh nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its Dignity, and Authority; for ſuch a Conveyance will argue the Church only for the Deriver (as the Head, Mother, or Principall Church of the Weſt) not the Originall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the Creed; and, 'tis generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119760:116"/> that the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> in the firſt Ages, was moſt famous for the purity of the Orthodoxe Faith; and the uncorrupt keeping of Traditions, eſpecially Doctrinall. Laſtly, that the <hi>Eaſterne Churches</hi> uſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creeds, hath been alſo diſproved, if by [others] be meant Creeds diverſe in meaning, and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Articles: Therefore the concluſion, namely, that the Creed was framed by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Clergy of Rome,</hi> of its own accord falles unto the Ground.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I endeavoured, not only to bring poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Arguments for the aſſerting of this Ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but withall to anſwer all thoſe Objections which are brought againſt it; a Taske, farre the more difficult of the two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it is an untrodden Path, wherein I had neither Helpe nor Guide; no man, till theſe late buſy Times, having ever preſumed to write againſt the Authority, or the Authors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe it is uſually a farre eaſier labour, to eſtabliſh a received Truth, then to demoliſh all the ſpecious objections which are raiſed againſt it. I ſhall deſire to meet with the ſame candor in my Reader, whoſoever he be that ſhall compare theſe Arguments and Anſwers together, which I have uſed towards the Objectors, whoſe Perſons I have not ſo much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, (as having no quarrell to them) but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with their Objections: and, whatſoever my Anſwers be, their Arguments I am ſure, are ſet down at full, and to the beſt advantage, leaſt otherwiſe I might ſeeme to have fought with my own ſhadow. Let the indifferent Reader ſee, and judge.</p>
                  <p>Yet, if after all this, I be farther asked by the more curious enquirer, which of all thoſe Creeds or Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119760:116"/> that wee meet with in Antiquity, and which I have here produced, came <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in expreſſe words from the Apoſtles, neither more, nor leſſe, not the leaſt particle varied?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer;</hi> Firſt, That this queſtion, as it hath much difficulty in it, ſo it hath little neceſſity; for as long as thoſe Creeds agreed in the ſubſtance of the Faith, it matters little or nothing, though there be ſome variety of expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>This indeed might make way for a difference in ſubſtance, if done raſhly, upon a private judgement, and a deſigne of countenancing ſome new opinion: but not ſo, when done by the generall conſent of the Church, aſſembled in a Synod, which is ſuppoſed, not only to have the words of the Creed, but alſo the true ſenſe thereof kept in her, by Tradition, as an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Depoſitum;</hi> and withall, to be directed by the Holy Ghoſt, ſo as not to erre in any neceſſary, fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Poynt, ſuch as the Articles of the Creed are. The <hi>Socinians</hi> indeed, would have the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> to differ in ſubſtance from that of the Apoſtles, but ſuch a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is not to be much wondered at in them, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the Hereſies condemned by that Creed, and by the two Councels which compoſed it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Amongſt all the forementioned Creeds, thoſe which we may have moſt probable recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as the exact Patternes, or Modells of the reſt, the Apoſtles genuine Births as well for words as matter, are the Creed of the <hi>Jeroſolymitan</hi> Church, explained by <hi>Cyril;</hi> and the Creed of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> which we of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> now commonly call the <hi>Apoſtles Creed;</hi> for theſe two are moſt compleat in themſelves, and moſt conſonant to each others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; The Creed of the <hi>Jeroſolymitan Church</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119760:117"/> to be the Apoſtles, becauſe that was the Antient mother Church of the whole World, where Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity firſt began, and from thence was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto all Nations; and wherein the Apoſtles are ſaid to have compoſed the Creed, before they went unto the Gentilks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; The Church of Rome alſo hath a very faire Plea for her Antiquity and Integrity.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe that Church was founded by the two Prime Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe ſhe was in the greateſt Repute, for the firſt Ages, as the moſt uncorrupt preſerver of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and keeper of <hi>Apoſtolicall Tradition,</hi> when other Churches ſwerved from the Apoſtolick Doctrine: whence it is, that the Fathers of thoſe Ages frequently appeale to her, in their writings againſt Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe Hereſies ariſing in other Churches, forced them to adde ſome explicatory Particles to the Creed, thereby to vindicate the <hi>Faith</hi> from Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and diſtinguiſh themſelves from unſound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: but the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> had this happineſſe for a long while, that no Hereſy ſprang up in her, which by infecting her Children, inforced her to this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; for that of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> was about Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Diſcipline, rather a Schiſme then a Hereſy; and <hi>Blaſtus,</hi> was a <hi>Quartadecuman,</hi> Erring only about the time of keeping Eaſter. As for <hi>Florinus</hi> and <hi>Praxeas;</hi> the one was no Romane, but a ſtranger, and ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and both, upon Diſcovery were baniſhed, as it ſeems; for we heare not of any great harme they did, or ſtore of Diſciples they led after them. Now, this felicity of the Romane Church, cauſed them to keep their Creed entire, according as they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119760:117"/> it from the Apoſtles, their firſt renowned Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without any Alteration or Addition, ſo much as in the manner of expreſſion; to which purpoſe we may conſult theſe three following Teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, S. <hi>Amb.</hi> in his forecited Epiſtle to <hi>Syricius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, exhorts all to believe the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> which the Church of Rome hath alwaies preſerved [<hi>intemeratum</hi>] untoucht, and inviolate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in his Expoſition of the Creed, upon thoſe words, [<hi>I believe in the Father Almighty</hi>] gives us this Admonition; <q>Illud non importunè commonendum puto, quod in diverſis Eccleſiis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua in his verbis inveniuntur adjecta, in Eccleſiâ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men urbis Romae hoc non deprehenditur factum; quod ego propterea eſſe arbitror, quòd ne<expan>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That is,</hi> I think it not unſeaſonable to give notice, that in diverſe Churches ſomewhat is added to theſe words; but not ſo, in the Church of Rome; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof I ſuppoſe to be this; becauſe neither any Hereſy there took its Riſe, and the ancient cuſtome is there alſo kept, that the Perſons who are to be baptized, publiquely rehearſe the Creed in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119760:118"/> on purpoſe to exclude the novelty of their Doctrines, by expreſſing the true ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Thirdly, <hi>Vigilius Biſhop of Rome,</hi> in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book againſt <hi>Eutyches,</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>

                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> ad nunc, &amp; ſub Beatae memoriae Caeleſtino, cui iſte rectae fidei testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium reddidit, ita fidelibus ſymbolum tradidit; nec praejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant verba, ubi ſenſus incolumis permanet.</hi> That is, The whole Church profeſſeth, to believe in <hi>God the Father Almighty; and in Ieſus Chriſt his Son, our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eutyches</hi> cavils at this laſt Article, becauſe it runs not thus, [<hi>In one Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne</hi>] according to the Decree of the <hi>Nicene Councell:</hi> whereas the Church of Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſembling of that Councell, from the Times of the Apoſtles untill this preſent, (and under <hi>Caeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of Bleſſed memory, the rightneſſe of whoſe faith <hi>Eutyches</hi> acknowledged) delivered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Creed in theſe Termes unto the faithfull; neither be the words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall, where the ſenſe is entire.</p>
                  <p>So then; That the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> kept the Creed inviolate, this Apoſtolicall Tradition faithfully, and entirely; witneſſe here S. <hi>Ambroſe, Ruffinus,</hi> and <hi>Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> And, that the Apoſtles diſtinguiſht it into twelve Articles, according to their own number, witneſſe (as hath been ſhewn before) the ſame S. <hi>Ambroſe, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> and <hi>Leo the Great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, becauſe theſe two Creeds, of the <hi>Ieroſolymitan</hi> and <hi>Romane Churches,</hi> differ ſomething in the Bulke, that of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> being ſomewhat the larger; we may, if we pleaſe to make them exactly agree, cut off thoſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119760:118"/> Additionall Particles from the Creed of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which were added becauſe of Hereſies, ſuccreſcent in thoſe Eaſterne Parts.</p>
                  <p>But if we let them alone, the difference will not appeare conſiderable; rather, an admirable Harmony will be obſerved betweene the ſo diſtant Churches of Eaſt and Weſt, in matter of Faith, which otherwiſe, in Diſcipline and Ceremonies, did not a little vary. Thus, the Churches Coat, like that of Chriſt her ſpouſe, was ſeamles, though wrought with diverſe Colours.</p>

               <p>Firſt; The Apoſtles had Ground, and warrant for compoſing this <hi>Breviary</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> from diverſe Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes in holy Writ, of Gods owne ſetting. King <hi>Solomon</hi> in the old law contracts the whole Duty of Man into theſe two precepts, <hi>Feare God, and keepe his Commandements Eccles.</hi> 12, 13. And a wiſer then he, in the Goſpell, our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> reduceth the whole
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:119760:119"/> Law unto theſe two Heads, <hi>The love of God, and our Neighbour Mat.</hi> 22. 37.</p>
               <p>More particularly; God the Father, in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, concluded the whole law of nature with al its Branches, within the compaſſe, of ten ſhort Precepts; and thoſe ten, he reduced into two Tables: Thus, we have a perfect Rule of Love, and obedience, from his Mouth. Then, God the Son, under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at his Diſciples requeſt, gave us an exact Forme of Prayer, whereby to ground, exerciſe, and regulate our hopes and deſires. There remained now in the compiled ſome ſhort compleat Rule of <hi>Faith</hi> which the holy Ghoſt heere did, delivering this Creed unto the Church by the Mouthes of the Apoſtles, to be for ever kept therein as a ſacred <hi>Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we three Briefe, but Full Rules of thoſe Fundamentall, Chriſtian virtues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> namly, The <hi>Creed,</hi> The <hi>Lords Paryer,</hi> and The <hi>Ten Commandements;</hi> delivered unto us by the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Sacred Trinity.</p>
               <p>Secondly; The Framing of the Creed was moſt neceſſary for theſe two ends: tht preſervation of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, For the eaſe, and ſafety of Chriſtians; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, of the plainer, weaker, and more Ignorant ſort. Many have not the ability, or leiſure to peruſe the whole Body of Scripture, and thence to collect thoſe Points of <hi>Faith</hi> which are neceſſary to Salvation; for they lye confuſedly ſcatterd heere &amp; there, mixt with matter of a diverſe kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, ſome Articles of the Creed are not expreſly and directly found in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Place of holy writ, (as the eight and ninth; together with the myſtery of the Trinity, which is
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119760:120"/> therein conteined) but depend on Conſequences, and Logicall deductions, which though ſufficiently cleare in themſelves upon a juſt arguing, or comparing, of Places, yet it cannot be preſumed that every one hath the skill to Frame them; ſo that there would be much feare of errour, and danger of miſtake in ſo weighty a Buſineſſe. Wherefore it was very expedient, or rather abſolutely neceſſary, that there ſhould be gathered a ſummary of theſe points, digeſted into a method, and expreſt in plaine tearms; and that by an unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unerring hand; that ſo wee might know what to truſt to, and have alwayes at hand thoſe maine grounds of our Religion, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be believed by us, as neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

               <p>Secondly; For the due bounding of our Faith and Charity. There are many leſſer, circumſtantiall Points in divinity which Chriſtians may differ about, <hi>Salva Fide &amp; Charitate;</hi> without prejudice to either: but, others there be of farre higher Concernment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the very beeing of a true, and rightly grounded Chriſtian; theſe we call Fundamentall Points; the Neſcience of moſt whereof, but the denyall of any, is deſtructive of Salvation, whithout enſuing repentance. Now, it was neceſſary, that theſe ſhould be knowen, and ſevered from the reſt, that ſo the Church might know whome to admit to Baptiſme, and acknowledg for her Children, and on the other ſide, Whom to reject, or cut off, as Heretickes, misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Yea beſides, that every private Chriſtian might know by this Rule, whom to communicate with, and whom to fly from and avoid, as Heathens and Publicans in our Saviours Language.</p>
               <p>To demonſtrate this Father, (namely that the <hi>Creed</hi> conteines all Points which a good Chriſtian is bound of neceſſity to believe) I ſhall produce a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or two, and thereto ſubjoine the teſtimonies of the Ancients; which, among other Corollaries hence deducible, will ſerve to free the true reformed Churches from that juſt imputation of Hereſy, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been pleaſed to lay upon
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119760:121"/> Them; for al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> generally &amp; unanimouſly imbrace the Creed, as appeares by their ſeverall confeſſions; and therfore cannot juſtly be charged with hereſy in the ancient, (which is the true, and genuine) accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word.</p>
               <p>The reaſons are theſe two which follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt; the End, for which the <hi>Apoſtles Framed the Creed,</hi> cannot be imagined to be any other than this, <hi>viz.</hi> To give us a <hi>Breviary</hi> of the <hi>fundamentall Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> Dare we ſay, that the Apoſtles came ſhort of this their end? It muſt be then either for want of Power or want of will. Now, to affirme they could not compaſſe it, is little better then Blaſphemy and to affirme they would not, when they might; muſt needs argue them of groſſe negligence in their function, and uncharitablneſſe to the Chriſtian church; faults wholy uncompatible with the Apoſtolick office, and Zeale.</p>

                  </gap> ſignifies <hi>Nota</hi> or <hi>Indicium;</hi> the Creed being the note of difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true Children of the Church, and thoſe who were either unbelievers or misbelievers. And, the Rule of Faith, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it; or, The Rule of Truth, as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> That unerring Rule of Truth which we received in Baptiſme; (from whom <hi>Chryſoſtome and Auſtin</hi> borrowed the terme who oppoſed the Creed to the <hi>Placita</hi> of Hereticks; and will have them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <hi>ad hujus amuſſim,</hi> by the line or Rule of the Creed) muſt be adequate to the Faith or neceſſary Truth, whereof it is a Rule, niether larger, nor
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:119760:121"/> narrower; for elſe, it looſeth the very nature of a Rule.</p>
               <p>To this Truth the Fathers give in their Suffrages; I ſhall ſet downe the Teſtimonies of ſome, who were the moſt Ancient, and the moſt famous in their Times.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> after he had reckoned up thoſe Heads of the Creed, which touched our Saviour, concludes thus <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, He, who fully knowes, and believes theſe things, is Bleſſed, that is as fare as concernes theſe Articles, or this part of the Faith, which relates to our Saviour; the ſame holdes, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the reſt; otherwiſe, not only a right beliefe (although full, and entire,) but a good life alſo, are requiſite to happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tels us, that many barbarous Nations, who had not the Bookes of Scripture among them, yet, <hi>Sine Charactere, vel atramento, Scriptam habuerunt per Spiritum ſanctum in Cordibus ſuis ſalutem,</hi> Had Salvation wrote in their Hartes by the Finger of the holy Ghoſt without the helpe of Pen, and Inke. Where, by [<hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>] he underſtands the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Creed;</hi> (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> That is, Neither the moſt able Orator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Paſtors of the Church, can ſay more than this (for no man is above his Teacher or Maſter) neither he who is weake in ſpeech, can diſtinguiſh (or, ſpeake leſſe than) this Tradition; for there beeing one and the ſame Faith neither he who is able to ſpeake much of it, hath augmented it; nor he who is able to ſay litle, hath leſſened it at all.</p>

               <p>Now, how the Church of Rome, which gives this Teſtimony of the fulneſſe of the <hi>Creed</hi> for the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and makes it the Diſtinctive marke, whereby to know her true, genuine Children, from the Baſtardy of Hereticks, can juſtly adde many other Articles to it, (as <hi>Pius</hi> 4. doth, in his <hi>Bull De profeſſione fidei</hi>) to be believed as neceſſary to Salvation; and for the not receiving of them, as undoubtedly Catholick, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Truths, together with the Apoſtolick Articles,

                  </gap>. Now this acception of the word, well ſuits with the <hi>Creed,</hi> as having reference both to the Makers and the Matter.

               </p>
               <p>This alſo well conſorts with an other ſignification of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119760:127"/> the word, mentioned by <hi>Pliny. Nat. Hist. lib. 33. cap.</hi> 1.

                  </gap>e: which graines aptly ſignify the ſeverall Parts; and, the orbicular figure, the Perfection of the Creed.</p>
               <p>This reaſon of the name, we find given by <hi>Clemens Romanus, Ruffinus,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin, Caſſianus,</hi> and <hi>Venantius Fortunatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; The word ſignifies <hi>Teſſera Pacti,</hi> a <hi>Tally in Contracts;</hi> a Bond, or Indenture, ſuch as we make with God in our Baptiſme, by profeſſion of our Faith in the <hi>Creed,</hi> wherein the Articles of our Covenant with God (for matter of Beliefe) are comprized, from which if we recede, we breake our Covenant, and ſo renounce our Chriſtendome, thereby forfeiting all the priviledges of our Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>This reaſon of the name is rendred by <hi>Chryſologus, Hom. 62. in Symb. Placitum, vel pactum quod lucri ſpes veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis continet, vel futuri, Symbolum nuncupari, contractu etiam docemur humano; quod tamen Symbolum inter duos format ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per geminata conſcriptio, &amp; in ſtipulatione cautum reddit huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na cautela, ne cui ſurrepat, ne quem decipiat perfidia contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſemper inimica. Sed hoc inter homines, inter quos fraus, a quo facta est, aut cui facta eſt, ſemper laedit: inter Deum vero, &amp; homines, Symbolum fidei ſola fide firmatur; non literae, ſed ſpiritui creditur; &amp; mandatur cordi, non chartae; quia divinum Creditum humana non indiget Cautione.</hi> And alittle after; <hi>Sed dicis; qui falli non poteſt quid est quod exiget Placitum? Quid Symbolum quaerit? quaerat ille propter te, non propter ſe; non quia ille dubitat, ſed ut tu Credas.</hi> The ſumme is; That in humane Contracts there are required two <hi>Symbola</hi> or
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119760:128"/> 
                  <hi>Tabellae,</hi> the <hi>Indenture</hi> and the <hi>Counterpane,</hi> and both theſe in writing to prevent miſtakes, and cheatings: but one only is required in our Baptiſmall contract, or Covenant, to wit, our Bond giuen to God, not in writing, but by way of parole, publiſht in the face of the Church. The reaſon is; becauſe God can be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decieved, nor decieve; but we, unleſſe thus bound, might through humane frailty, more eaſily depart from the Faith profeſt, and in fringe our Articles, not to the decieving of God, (who knowes us better than our ſelves) but to the deſtroying of our Grace, and the forfeiting of our glory.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; The word ſignifies, <hi>Teſsera Amicitiae,</hi> or <hi>Teſsera hoſpitalis,</hi> a certaine Token, which not only particular men gave to their Friends and Allies, but which Citties alſo publikly be ſtowed on ſome well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving men, that ſo, in their Travailes, they might (upon producing thereof) be friendly received, and courteouſly entertained in the confederate Townes. So <hi>Budaeus</hi> informes us out of <hi>Lyſias</hi> the Orator. Now, this Confeſſion of our Faith in the <hi>Creed,</hi> hath the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119760:128"/> ſame nature and uſe among all Churches whereſoever diſperſt over the face of the whole Earth; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever brings this <hi>Teſsera,</hi> or <hi>Token</hi> with him is to be received as a Brother—But if there come any unto you ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your Houſe, neither bid him, God ſpeed. 2 <hi>Io.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>To this Sence alludes <hi>Leo</hi> the Great, in his Epiſtle or Tract againſt <hi>Eutyches Fraterna vos &amp; paterna ſolicitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine commonemus, ut inimicos Catholicae fidei, hoſtes Eccleſiae, incarnationis dominicae negatores, &amp; inſtituto a Sanctis Apoſtolis Symbolo repugnantes, in nullum recipiatis conſenſionis affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> we warne you out of a fraternall, and a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care, that ye receive not into your communion the enimies of the Catholick Faith the adverſaries of the Church, the Denyers of the Lords incarnation and the oppugners of the Creed by the holy Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; The word ſignifies <hi>Inſigne militare, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Flag, Enſigne,</hi> or <hi>Banner,</hi> by which Souldiers are knowen to what Captaine or Generall they belong. So <hi>Herodian</hi> in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> booke of his hiſtory tells us of the Emperour <hi>Antonius Caracalla;</hi> that partly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himſelfe the more with the Souldiers; partly, to harden himſelfe in warlike exerciſes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, He ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bare on his own ſhoulders the weightieſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of the Army. Now, this ſignification alſo well agrees to the <hi>Creed;</hi> for by this Profeſſion of our Faith, we ſhew that we belong to Chriſt our Generall, fighting under his Banner againſt our three enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Divell: His Cognizance we take on us in our Baptiſme, by atteſting to the Creed; either in our own Perſons, if <hi>Adulti:</hi> or, if <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, in Perſonis Suſceptorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:119760:129"/>
               <p>Fiftly; The word ſignifies <hi>Teſſera militaris, a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, whereby Souldiers of the ſame Army, or Campe know one an other, and diſcerne themſelves from the Enemy.</hi> Which ſignification, among all the Reſt, ſeemes moſt proper to the Creed, becauſe by this profeſſion of the Faith, Chriſtians are diſtinguiſht, not only from <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> but, more eſpecially from Hereticks, thoſe Renegados, and Deſerters of the Chriſtian Faith.

There is much diference, betweene the flower of Youth and the fading of Age, yet they are the ſame ſtill. Their Bulke and ſtature, diverſe; but the ſame nature, and the ſame Perſon, as before The limbes of Children, are little; of Men growen, large; yet, both the ſame: the Infant hath as many members, as the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growen; neither appeares there, ought new in the old, which lay not hidden, and (as it were) incloſed in the young; ſo that riper Age doth but produce that to open view, which the ſeminall vertue concealed, and ſhut up in a narrower roome—But, if in proceſſe of Time, the humane ſhape ſhould be changed into that of a diverſe kind; if ought ſhould be added to the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119760:133"/> juſt number of Parts, or taken from it; the whole Body muſt of neceſſity periſh, grow prodigious, or (at leaſt) inſenſibly Pine away. So, the Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion muſt obſerve theſe Rules of Growth, that in proceſſe of years, it get ſtrength, ſpread, &amp; hieghten; yet ſtil remaine entire, and unaltered in all its parts; nothing added, changed, or cut off.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt all the Creeds, this of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> hath met with moſt oppoſition; Firſt, becauſe it hath moſt reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrictly oppugned the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and Moderne Hereſies, about thoſe great Poynts of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation;</hi> for, whereas other Creeds proceed by way of ſimple Confeſſion, Narration, or Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Faith, <hi>I Believe &amp;c.</hi> This runnes in an higher ſtyle, more directly repugnant to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Chriſtian Faith—<hi>Whoſoever will be ſaved,

Secondly, becauſe it was the worke, and compoſure of a Private man, whereas the other Creeds either challenge the Colledge of the Apoſtles for the Authors, or the Catholick Church aſſembled in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; or, at leaſt, the Tradition of ſome Patriarchall, or other Ancient and famous Church, time out of mind; whereas this of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> though relying but upon a ſingle Fathers Authority, yet ſpeakes much bigger than the Reſt, and expreſſely requires a more exact obedience, than any of the other.</p>
               <p>Now, this double reaſon hath raiſed both it, and its Author, many Adverſaries; whereof, ſome have ſtyled the <hi>Preface</hi> of it, <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Inſolent:</hi> others, have denied <hi>Athanaſius</hi> for the <hi>Author,</hi> ſo to leave it deſtitute of a <hi>Patron,</hi> and deprive it of the <hi>Authority</hi> of ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Champion of the Chriſtian Faith: a Third ſort have more impudently defamed both Worke and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and ſtyled it <hi>Sathanaſius his Creed,</hi> as one <hi>Geo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> as <hi>Genebrard</hi> tells us in his Epiſtle to <hi>Charles Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> prefixed to his Book <hi>De Trinitate.</hi> Among all which Adverſaries 'tis obſervable, that none have either denied the <hi>Author,</hi> or defamed the <hi>Creed,</hi> but ſuch whom the Church hath noted of Hereſy; and commonly, have been the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders to the Reſt.</p>

               <p>In this heat, and fury of oppoſition, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne us, calmely to examine the Truth, whereby we ſhall at once vindicate the Credit, both of the Creed, and its Compoſer.</p>
               <p>Firſt; for the Truth and Eſteeme of the Creed, it relies not on the Authority of one ſingle Father, who compoſed it (though never ſo famous in his time, and all Ages ſince, among the Orthodox Profeſſors) but on the Teſtimony of the Catholick Church, which hath received it, and commended it to all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as the Buckler of the true Chriſtian <hi>Faith:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only ſo, but hath received it of old into her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, and ſtill retaines it; an Honour not vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to any other Creed of a Private mans compoſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Conſtantinople, Rome,</hi> and the Reformed Churches, have joyntly received it, and expoſed it to publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que uſe, although they very much differ in other Poynts; a ſtrong argument of its Verity, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the credit of the Author; whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſults Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, and <hi>Nazianzens Encomiaſtick Oration,</hi> muſt needs acknowledge his great fame throughout the Chriſtian World, for his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Vertue, and unwearied Conſtancy in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Faith againſt the Arian Faction, under four Emperors Reignes, eſpecially under <hi>Conſtantius</hi> &amp; <hi>Valens,</hi> when they ſwayed all; which Undaunted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his, when the other Biſhops generally, either complyed with the Enemy, or kept ſilence for feare, deſervedly purchaſed this peculiar honor to his <hi>Creed,</hi> as the due reward of his unconquered Faith; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Fame unto ſucceeding Ages with ſo loud a Trumpe, that we heare <hi>Coſmas Laurens</hi> proclaime, <hi>Cum ex</hi> S. <hi>Athanaſii Opuſculis aliquid inveneris, nec ad ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum

               <p>Thirdly; As to the ſuppoſed <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Inſolency</hi> of the <hi>Preface,</hi> with which Termes ſome have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to dignify it, as being too ſtately for a private Mans worke, and too peremptorily excommunicating all Chriſtians, who out of Ignorance or myſperſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, imbrace not all the following deepe miſteryes contained in it; they may pleaſe alſo to take notice, that the Creed which followes, though for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure it Have <hi>Athanaſius</hi> only for the <hi>Author,</hi> yet the <hi>Faith</hi> therin ſet downe and explained, is the common received <hi>Faith</hi> of the Church, derived downe from the Apoſtles to his Times, and ſince commended by our Catholick Mother to ſucceeding Ages, as the Groundworke of Chriſtian Religion moſt neceſſary to be firſt laid, and relyed on; and therefore may well beare ſuch a Proeme which refers not ſo much to the Authority of the writer, as to the Creed written: the compoſure was a private Mans, but the Creed was Publick; the Frame of one, but the Faith of All.</p>
               <p>Then, for the ſtrict exacting the beliefe of his Creed from all Chriſtians, they may pleaſe to obſerve, that it was wrote in oppoſition to the Arians, ſo that it doth not ſo directly exclude from Salvation the pure Ignorant, as the ſtuborne Heretick; nor, ſomuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the bare neſcience, as the negation of the <hi>Faith which was once delivered to the Saints.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119760:140"/> of the Bleſſed Trinity being the laſt End, or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mankind; and, the Incarnation of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with the conſequents thereof, being the meanes appointed by God for to compaſſe it. So that the great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſhewed not his Pride in prefixing ſuch a Proeme, but rather his mercy, and Paternall care towardes the Church by a more expreſſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the neceſſity of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> which ſome otherwiſe might have more oſcitantly hearkned to, and been leſſe carefull to entertaine, if not awakned by the Terror of this Preface.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now all theſe opinions may well agree, according to <hi>Poſſevins</hi> Conjecture, who (in his <hi>Apparatus, verbo, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi>) thinks it probable <hi>ut ſanct. Trinitatis acerrimus propugnator, hymnum illum</hi> (he meanes his Creed, becauſe ſung hymne-wſie in the Church-ſervice) <hi>locis quibus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit omnibus, ſcripſer it, cantaverit, diſſeminaverit.</hi> So that he might write it, at ſeverall times in all the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Places.</p>
               <p>Firſt; At <hi>Triers.</hi> (as the Inſcription of the Well
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:119760:150"/> there is ſaid to witneſſe) when he was firſt baniſht, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare, 336.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He might ſend it in writing to <hi>Iulius</hi> Biſhop of Rome, when the <hi>Euſebian</hi> faction ſent Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates unto him with letters, to accuſe <hi>Athanaſius Anno Domini</hi> 339.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He might give it in writing to the Synod at Rome, of which <hi>Iulius</hi> was preſident, to ſatisfy them all concerning his beliefe. <hi>A. D.</hi> 340.</p>
               <p>Laſtly; He might ſend it from a Synod at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, to the Emperour of the Eaſt; either to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> in his Synod held, <hi>A. D.</hi> 339. Or rather, to <hi>Iovianus,</hi> in his laſt Synod, held about the yeare 364, together with the Synodicall Epiſtle before mentioned; which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſeemes to imply in the forecited Oration, where he oppoſeth Emperour, to Emperour, as well as Doctrine to Doctrine; that is, the Catholick <hi>Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Arian, as well as the Orthodoxe Creed, to the Hereticall Confeſſions. Except we will ſay, that this Creed was exhibited in the Councell of <hi>Sardica</hi> (a famous City in Illyricum) held in the yeare 347, and called by <hi>Conſtans</hi> the Emperour of the Weſt, (who favoured <hi>Athanaſius</hi>) and by <hi>Constantius</hi> joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: or, to <hi>Valentinian</hi> the ſucceſſour of <hi>Iovianus;</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Athanaſius</hi> lived ſeaven or eight years; but for this wee have no Authors Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The ſame Creed was probably ſent alſo to <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhop of Rome, as we ſhall ſhew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
               <p>Secondly; As to the Ground or Cauſe whererupon <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Framed his Creed; I anſwer, that he wrote it to give an account of his Faith, &amp; to vindicate himſelf from the recrimination of his Adverſaries; who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of <hi>Sabellianiſme,</hi> as he did them of <hi>Ariniaſme.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:119760:150"/> who can with any likelyhood ſuppoſe, but that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his ſo many years perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> ſet forth ſome where the Confeſſion of his Faith, to cleare himſelfe, and that the Orthodoxe might ſee, for what cauſe they ſo pertinaciouſly vext him? Now, that this Creed is that Confeſſion will appeare, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what hath been already alleaged) by the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof both in words &amp; ſenſe, with thoſe more full &amp; large Treatiſes of his againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> whereof this ſeemes a <hi>Compendium;</hi> and, by the Conſtant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, which hath received this, and none other, as the Confeſſion or Creed of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> whoſe judgment ought to prevaile with us above the the raſhneſſe of ſome Novelliſts, who have queſtioned both the Authority &amp; the Author.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this Recrimination of Sabellianiſme is but obſcurely ſet downe in the writers of that Age, and utterly denyed by ſome of ours, I ſhall endeavour in a few worrdes to clear it.</p>
               <p>Firſt; It was the cuſtome of that Age, that when any was advanced to a Biſhoprick, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, to a Patriarchall <hi>See,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Alxandria</hi> was, whereof <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was Biſhop he ſent about his <hi>Literae Formatae,</hi> or <hi>Encyclicae,</hi> wherein he teſtifyed his Faith unto the Chriſtian world, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Catholick Biſhops; and this was in uſe, whether the new Biſhop were ſuſpected of hereſy, or not. Now, there was far greater Cauſe for this in the caſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> when he appealed to <hi>Iulius</hi> Biſhop of Rome, as the moſt Eminent Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of the Church, and one not engaged in the quarrell between him, and the Euſebians. For it had litle ſtood with the gravity, &amp; impartiall upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch a Judge, to have preſently, with
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119760:151"/> an overforward affection, received a man into his Communion, laden with ſo many, and ſo heavy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, before he had given an Account of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: which, that it was the cuſtome then obſerved, and particularly in the caſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and his fellowes, is plainly ſet downe by <hi>Sozomen lib. 3. cap.</hi> 7. where, having premiſed that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops, being thruſt out by the Arian faction, fled unto <hi>Julius</hi> for ſuccour, he ſubjoynes—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is, The Biſhop of Rome having learned the crimes obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt each of them, after that he found them all agreeing in the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicene Councell,</hi> he received them into his Communion, as perſons of the ſame judgement with himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>Marcellus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> who was the chiefe of thoſe three Biſhops, that were thruſt out by the <hi>Arian</hi> faction, and fled to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> having formerly accuſed the <hi>Euſebians</hi> of the <hi>Arian Hereſy,</hi> and convicted them in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, was himſelfe alſo ſcandalized with the croſſe imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sabellianiſme,</hi> whereupon he freely made an Orthodox Confeſſion of his Faith at Rome, ſuch as the Synod lately held at <hi>Sardica</hi> had imbraced. Now, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> who was principally hated by the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebians,</hi> had the charge of Hereſy recriminated alſo upon him, appears by a paſſage of the ſame <hi>Julius</hi> in his Letter to the Eaſterne Biſhops then Aſſembled at <hi>Antioch,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Now as concerning <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> ſaith he, ſeeing ye have wrote touching him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as of one who thinkes impiouſly of, or againſt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:119760:151"/> Chriſt—where, the particle [<hi>Alſo</hi>] neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that the <hi>Orientall Biſhops,</hi> had accuſed the reſt of the ſame crime, and who but <hi>Athanaſius</hi> as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall of the Accuſed. See the place in <hi>Athan. Apolog. 2. pag. 548. Edit. Comm.</hi> And, his Epiſtle <hi>ad Solitarios,</hi> two leaves from the beginning. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> alſo in his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Her.</hi> 72. tels us, that this <hi>Marcellus,</hi> being accuſed by the <hi>Arians</hi> of <hi>Sabellianiſme,</hi> to <hi>Iulius</hi> Biſhop of Rome, voluntarily came to Rome, and having long, but in vaine, there expected the appearance of his Adverſaries, upon his departure left an Epiſtle with <hi>Iulius,</hi> wherein he ſets downe a <hi>Confeſſion of his Faith.</hi> His caſe is juſt parallell to that of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who was accuſed of the ſame Hereſy, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> there witneſſeth, and in like manner cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; this imputation of <hi>Sabellianiſme</hi> was ſo pertinaciouſly urged upon <hi>Athanaſius</hi> by his Arian perſecutors, that <hi>Liberius</hi> ſucceſſor to <hi>Julius</hi> in the Romane See, was conſtrained to ſend a ſhort Epiſtle to him, for farther ſatisfaction; wherein, having ſet downe his own <hi>Faith</hi> concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> he addes by way of Antitheſis—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the opinions of <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Arius,</hi> and all the forementioned Hereſies, to everlaſting puniſhment, according to the voyce of our Saviour, Then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: If thou then agreeſt with mee,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:119760:152"/> Brother <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in this Confeſſion (which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Faith, received in the holy, Catholick, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Church) as in the preſence of God, and his Chriſt; write unto me thy conſent, &amp; agreement ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with me, that ſo I may be aſcertained thereof, and without ſcruple performe thy commands. This Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Liberius</hi> with the reſcript of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> we find extant in the firſt Tome of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his workes.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his forecited <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Faith vindicates himſelfe from Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianiſme in theſe words—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is, We neither make the Father and the Sonne the ſame Perſon as the Sabellians doe, in this deſtroying the relation of the Sonne; neither doe we attribute to the <hi>Father</hi> that paſſible <hi>Body,</hi> which the Sonne tooke on him, for the Salvation of the whole world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; <hi>Sulpitius Severus lib. 20 hiſt.</hi> Tels us, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was condemn'd of <hi>Sabellianiſme</hi> in a certain Councell, by the Arians. Adde hereunto that <hi>Arius</hi> himſelfe in his Diſputation before <hi>Probus</hi> the Judge, taxeth <hi>Athanasius</hi> in theſe words; ſomtimes, ſaith he, he makes three appeare One, ſaying, But <hi>theſe three are one God:</hi> then, I know not by what ſtrang mixtion, he makes them Triforms, triple; ſaying, And <hi>this one God is the Trinity.</hi> So <hi>Geneb.</hi> To prevent ſuch miſtakes and cavils, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath a chapter, in his Workes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>Quod non tres Dii, that there are not three Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; As to my laſt Query; in what <hi>Language
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:119760:152"/> this Creed of Athanasius was originally written?</hi> I Anſwer, it is moſt probable that <hi>Athanasius</hi> firſt wrote it in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, as being a Language which he well vnderſtood, (although ſome have been pleaſed to deny it) and the Creed being exhibited unto <hi>Julius</hi> Biſhop of Rome in a Synod of Latine Biſhops. My reaſons are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt; The Latine edition of this Creed is the ſame in all Copies, whereas the Greek Copies vary, as Tranſlations uſe to doe. <hi>Genebrard,</hi> in his third booke <hi>De Trinitate,</hi> hath ſet downe three ſeverall verſions there of, out of the Latine into the Greeke; namely, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgatam, Dionysianam, &amp; Constantinopolitanam.</hi> The firſt is that which is commonly Printed. The laſt is that which the Church of <hi>Conſtantin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ple</hi> uſeth. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt is ſo called from <hi>Dionysius</hi> a Grecian Biſhop, entitled <hi>Zienenſis &amp; Firmiensis,</hi> who gave the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eited Manuſcript of the Proceſſion to <hi>Lazarus Bayffius;</hi> the Booke was fairly written by the Learned <hi>Nic. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phianus.</hi> And to theſe three, which are ſet downe and compared by <hi>Genebrard,</hi> we may adde a fourth, found in an <hi>Horologium</hi> of Greeke hymnes, compoſed by <hi>Thechara</hi> a Monke of Conſtantinople, and is ſet downe by the R. <hi>Armach</hi> in his Tract <hi>de Symb.</hi> which beſides that it hath much inſerted heere and there by the Greeke Tranſlator, very much differs in the reſidue from all the three former, as they alſo doe from each other.</p>
               <p>Secondly; As the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of Rome wrote in Latine to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the Eaſt, ſo thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> wrote their <hi>Formulae Fidei,</hi> and <hi>Paenitentiae libelli</hi> to him in Latine; as <hi>Serrarius</hi> informes us in his Diſcourſe on this Creed. Much more reaſon had <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to write this his Creed in Latine, it being exhibited at <hi>Rome</hi> in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:119760:153"/> a Synod of Latine Biſhops, on purpoſe to ſatisfy them concerning his Beliefe; moſt of whom, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, underſtood not the Greek Tongue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; The foreſaid reaſon is fortified by this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelfe well underſtood the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Tongue, and therefore needed not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them by an interpreter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which skill of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> is not only made probable, from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of other Greeke Biſhops, as <hi>Euſebius Caeſarienſis, Photinus,</hi> and others of this latter Age alſo, who joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſtudy of both Tongues together; and, from his long abode in the Weſterne Parts at ſeverall times, as at <hi>Triers,</hi> above two years, at <hi>Millain,</hi> and <hi>Aquileia;</hi> and at Rome above 18 moneths: but clearly proved from that forecited paſſage of <hi>Nazianzene, Orat. 21. Num.</hi> 46, 47. Which I brought by way of Anſwer to the eight Objection, againſt the Apoſtles Creed; where he tells us, how <hi>Athanaſius</hi> compoſed the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Greek and Latine Churches, about the words Hypoſtaſis, and <hi>Eſſentia, verborum ſententiâ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenter &amp; accurate perpenſâ,</hi> having diligently and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately weighed the meaning of the wordes; at length peſwading both Parties that it was but a <hi>Logomachia,</hi> a contention about Termes, ſince both ment the ſame Thing. Now ſuch a Controverſy as this could never have been ſtated, with ſo full a ſatisfaction to both Parties, unleſſe he had been furniſhed with more than ordinary skill, as well in the Latine, as the Greeke.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Thay who aſcribe this Creed to <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> agree not either about the Time, or place <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> ſaith it was written in his firſt Baniſhment at Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where he lay hid in a Well, to avoid the treacheries of the Arians. <hi>Manuell Caleca,</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> ſay, it was
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:119760:154"/> wrote to P. <hi>Iulius,</hi> either from his Dioceſſe at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria; or given in writing to him, and the Roman Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod when he pleaded his Cauſe before them, that ſo he might be received into the Communion of the Church of Rome, wherein <hi>Baronius,</hi> is deceived more wayes than one. firſt, becauſe not only heere, but in the the whole worke of his <hi>Annals,</hi> he laboures to prove, that in all Ages the Biſhop of Rome had full Power to cite, abſolve, or condemne the Biſhops of the Eaſt, and of the whole World. Secondly, becauſe <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was not accuſed for matter of Doctrine by the Arians, but for matter of fact; and his reſtitution to his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick oppoſed by them, for Politicall inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; as that his returne had once already cauſed ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Slaughters in Alexandria: &amp; that he had been reſtored to his <hi>See</hi> contrary to the Canons, as one condemned by the Synod of Tyre, and not yet abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Thirdly, becauſe if he had needed to render an account of his Faith to <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of Triers, or <hi>Iulius</hi> of Rome, Hee would have uſed none other than the Necene Creed; it being not opportune to have uſed any other at that Time, for feare he migt have been thought to imitate the Arians, and Semi-Arians, who ever and anon framed new Confeſſions in their Synods &amp; ante-Synods, on purpoſe to depreciate the Nicene Creed, as falſe, imperfect, or obſcure; and for this very reaſon, were chiefly hated by the Catholicks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1. The ſeverall opinions about the Time and Place, where and when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Publiſhed his Creed, are but circumſtantiall differences, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not deſtructive of the main buſines; except we wil therefore deny an Hell, becauſe Divines differ about the Place where it is ſeated, and the Time when it was prepared. Beſides, all theſe differences are eaſy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:119760:154"/> to be reconciled, as I have ſhewed already, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my riſe from <hi>Poſſevins</hi> judgement.</p>
               <p>As for the Well at <hi>Triers,</hi> what ever <hi>Baronius</hi> may judge of it, yet if it beare that Inſcription which <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevine</hi> witneſſeth, it may probably enough have been the Place where <hi>Athanaſius</hi> at firſt compoſed this <hi>Creed</hi> of his; either lying in it there for ſhelter at his firſt coming to <hi>Triers,</hi> till he had made his innocency known to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the younger, and to <hi>Maximus</hi> the Biſhop of the place: or, inſcribing that Title on it, in imitation of the Apoſtles Creed, which was framed in a like place, as we find it recorded by <hi>Fr.

               <p>The <hi>Nicene Councell</hi> was called againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> who denyed the Sonne to be Coeſſentiall and Coeternall with the Father; Thoſe Fathers therefore enlarged the ſecond Article of the Creed, touching the eternall Divinity of the Sonne of God. The Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> was called againſt <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Divinity of the holy Ghoſt; whence, thoſe Fathers enlarged the eight Article of the Creed, which concernes the Third Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>As for the Forme of words, or Frame of this Creed; it had, in the firſt Place, <hi>Hoſius</hi> Biſhop of Corduba for the Compoſer, who ſate in the Councell of Nice as Preſident or Moderator, by the appointment of the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; and therefore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the firſt Place, before <hi>Vitus,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius,</hi> who were the Biſhop of Romes Legats; as we may ſee in <hi>Binius, Conc.

               <p>But the Additionall Particles, or ſupplement of this Creed, was made by <hi>Gregory Nyſsen,</hi> an eminent Father in the firſt Conſtantinopolitan Councell, who perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and compleated the Forme, as we now have it.

               <p>After this, the Fathers of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Councell enlarged this Forme, partly by adding ſome <hi>explicatory particles;</hi> and partly by reſuming out of the Apoſtles Creed thoſe Articles, wherein it was defective.

               <p>The Greekes lay the blame of this Addition on Pope <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> who thruſt <hi>Leo</hi> the Fift out of his Chaire, in the yeare 908. and after ſeaven Moneths was in like manner dejected by <hi>Sergius.</hi> But <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> gives a reaſon to the contrary, Anno 888. <hi>Nullo pacto poſſunt tribui ista Chriſtophoro, qui invaſor Apoſtolicae Sedis, mox ſede pulſus, perbrevi tempore eam tenuit tumultuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sè.</hi> That is; This Addition cannot be aſcribed to Pope <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> who having invaded the Apoſtolick See, was quickly thruſt out againe, having held it but a very little while, and that in great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, with more probability, we may attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this Addition to Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> his Succeſſour, who made this buſineſſe of the Proceſſion his firſt and chiefe work; and ſent unto the French Biſhops, to gather the moſt ſolid Arguments they could find, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Errour of the Greekes; upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of which letters, a Synod was called at Soiſſons. 6 <hi>Cal.

               <p>And, this may be the reaſon, why the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane writers, never delivered to poſterity the name of that Pope, who contrary to the Precept and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of his Predeceſſor <hi>Leo</hi> 3. undertook to adde this Particle to the Creed; namely, becauſe they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of ſuch an Author as <hi>Sergius,</hi> an uſurper of the <hi>See,</hi> and one of a moſt infamous life; whom if they had alleadged, they had laid both themſelves, and their cauſe, open to the ſcoffes and railings of the Greekes, who would greedily have laid hold on ſuch an advantage.

               <p>Thus began, and thus continued, the deplorable Schiſme between the Churches of Eaſt and Weſt; the cauſes whereof were theſe that follow.</p>

                  </hi>] to the <hi>Nicene,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Creed;</hi> not only without, but againſt the Conſent of the Eaſterne Churches, who had compoſed that Creed; but were never called to that Synod, wherein this Alteration was made; yea, ſtill proteſted againſt it. But, which was more; this
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:119760:168"/> Addition was made in contempt of the third generall Councell held at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which expreſſely forbad it, and denounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt him, whoſoever ſhould dare to alter this Creed, by Addition or Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. For though an Oecumenicall Synod cannot abſolutely preſcribe to another Oecumenicall (whence, the firſt Councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi> added much, by way of explication, to the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi>) yet it may preſcribe Lawes to Inferiour Synods, whether Provinciall, or Nationall; ſo that, nothing ought to be done in the common cauſe of the Faith, but by the common Judgment, and determination of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Greeks complaine. And, when the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines afterward urged (the Authority of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>See,</hi> now growing daily greater) that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome by a peculiar priviledge, derived from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles, was to take care that the Church received no Damage; that he had an infallible Judgment, by the ſpeciall, Gift of the holy Ghoſt, in all controverſies of Faith, and authority to decide them, ſo that there was no neceſſity he ſhould expect the judgment of the Eaſterne Churches; and, that this was the Priviledge of the firſt See, which had received the Primacy from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Chriſts vicar on Earth.</p>
               <p>The Greeks replyed. Firſt; that S. <hi>Peter</hi> never chalenged that priviledge to himſelfe, to judge alone and to be judged of none; for, being called in queſtion, that he had converſed with the Gentiles, he was faine to make an Apology for himſelfe in the publick audience of the Church. <hi>Act.</hi> 11. And when the Controverſy aroſe, whether the Gentiles ſhould be
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119760:168"/> circumciſed, and obſerve the Ceremoniall Law; no Appeale was made to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but a Synod was called, wherin, though he ſpake firſt yet <hi>Iames,</hi> as Biſhop of Jeruſalem, the place where the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod was called, decided the queſtion, and ſeemes to have ſate therein as Preſident. Beſides, S. <hi>Paul</hi> reſiſted him to his face at Antioch, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuked him for cauſing others to Judaize by his example; as we Read, <hi>Galatians,</hi> 2. 14. Which he would not have preſumed to doe, if he had conceived him endued with ſuch a ſupereminent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
               <p>So then, there appeares nought in <hi>Peter</hi> above the reſt of the Apoſtles but a Primacy of order, or of Dignity, at the moſt; ſuch as is acknowledged to be fit in the Church of God; and this Primacy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, either for that he was firſt called, or for his Age, or Zeale, or that he was commonly the firſt Speaker, and ſo rather the Mouth than the Head of the Apoſtles: but there appears no Primacy of order or Juriſdiction over his fellow-Apoſtles. But ſuppoſe we ſhould grant, ſaid they, that <hi>Peter</hi> had ſuch an unerring, paramount privilege; yet this might well be perſonall, and annext to his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not derivable to any Epiſcopall ſucceſſour: and, if derivable; why ſhould the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> rather arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it to himſelfe, than the Biſhop of Antioch, in which City S. <hi>Peter</hi> firſt ſate? Or, the Biſhop of Alexandria, a See inſtituted by the ſame Apoſtle, under S. <hi>Marke,</hi> before he ever appointed any Biſhop at Rome? As for the Grounding of this priviledge on S. <hi>Peters</hi> martyrdome at Rome; where appears any ſuch Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, or legacy bequeathed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119760:169"/> and Supremacy ſhould be annexed to that Chaire alone, as to the place of his Death and Buriall.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, they confeſt, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was of old accounted, <hi>Primae Sedis Epiſcopus,</hi> The Biſhop of the Principall See: but withall, they ſaid, that there was a vaſt difference between Primacy, and Power; for, if by this pretence, he ſhould challenge any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or Juriſdiction over the Biſhop of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, the Second See; Why ſhould not he of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople likewiſe, claime the ſame Power over the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which is the third? And ſo, in like manner, <hi>Alexandria</hi> over <hi>Antioch? Antioch</hi> over <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> An opinion never heard of, or entertained in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of Rome therefore had this primacy, not by divine right, but by humane, or Eccleſiaſticall: that is, not from any Apoſtolicall Priviledge derived from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but by the graunt of Emperours, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Councells. It was fit, that one Biſhop ſhould be chiefe for order ſake; &amp; this Honour was given to the Biſhop of Rome for the Dignity of his Seat, Rome beeing the Head of the Roman Empire. For which cauſe, <hi>Alexandria</hi> had of old the Second place, as beeing <hi>Praefectura Auguſtalis,</hi> the Peculiar of the Romane Emperour, ſo ennobled by <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar: Antioch,</hi> the third, as the Metropolis of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the Eaſtern Countryes adjoyning: whereas, if the preeminency of <hi>Sees</hi> had been derived from S. <hi>Peter;</hi> the City of Antioch, where he ſate ſeven years in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould have beene preferd before <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he only ſent an other, <hi>viz,</hi> S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for the firſt Biſhop.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:119760:169"/>
               <p>And for this cauſe <hi>Caeſarea</hi> too was made the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politicall <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> becauſe it was the ſeat of the <hi>Roman Governor;</hi> untill the Fathers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in honour of Jeruſalem, where S. <hi>James</hi> was made the firſt Biſhop of the Chriſtian world, and whence the Goſpell ſpread into the whole earth, gave the Biſhop therof a Patriarchall title, &amp; that, rather of dignity, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Authority; for thus runs the ſeventh Canon of that Councell, <hi>Quoniam mos antiquus obtinuit, &amp; vetuſta Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio, ut Aeliae, id eſt, Hieroſolimorum Epiſcopo honor Defera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, habeat conſequenter honorem, manente tamen Metropolitanae Civitatis (Caeſareae) propriâ Dignitate.</hi> that is, Becauſe, from an old Cuſtome and Tradition, honuor hath been given to the Biſhop of Aelia, that is, of Jeruſalem, let him have Honour accordingly, provided that the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the metropolitan City (<hi>Ceſarea</hi>) remaine entire.</p>
               <p>For the ſame cauſe alſo, when Conſtantinople was reedifyed, made the ſeat of the Empire, and called new Rome, by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, it was thought fit by the Emperours and ſucceeding Councells, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Alexandria ſhould no longer have the Second, but the third Place, Conſtantinople now ſucceeding in that honour; for thus runs the fift Canon of the firſt Councell of Conſtantinople, <hi>Conſtantinopolitanae Civitatis Epiſcopum habere oportet Primatus honorem poſt Romanum Epiſcopum, propter quod ſit nova Roma.</hi> that is, The Biſhop of Conſtantinople ought to have the next place of honour after the Biſhop of Rome, becauſe his City is new Rome. And becauſe there could not be two <hi>Sedes primae,</hi> two firſt or chief <hi>Sees;</hi> the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ordeined that the Biſhop of Conſtantinople ſhould be ſtyled, the ſecond Patriarch, but in all other things,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:119760:170"/> ſhould be of equall Dignity and Authority with the Biſhop of Rome.</p>
               <p>So, in all the reſt; whoſoever will pleaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Prelates <hi>Sees</hi> with the <hi>Notitia Imperii,</hi> ſhall find that the Church ſtill accommodated her Hierarchy of Mertropolita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Archbiſhops, &amp; Biſhops, unto the ſtate of the Empire, the diſtinction of Provinces, and the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Cityes, according to that ancient Rule, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia eſt in Republicâ, non Reſpublica in Eccleſiâ,</hi> The Church is in the Commonwealth, not the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond cauſe of the Schiſme, was the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> and <hi>Excomunication</hi> of the Patriarch <hi>Photius,</hi> and of the other <hi>Prelats,</hi> and <hi>Abbots</hi> his adherents, in a great Synod at Conſtantinople, held under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Baſiliu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and the Patriarch <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in the yeare 869, which buſineſſe was mainly urged, and furthered by two Biſhops of Rome ſucceſſively, <hi>viz. Nicolas</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third cauſe, was the <hi>Raſh</hi> and <hi>Inconſiderate</hi> Zeale of the ſaid Patriarch <hi>Photius,</hi> who firſt dared to accuſe the Romane Church of Hereſy, becauſe it held that the <hi>holy Ghoſt proceeded from the Sonne, as well as from the Father;</hi> whereas in all former diſputes between the Greeks and the Latines, whether by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, neither party accuſed his Adverſary of Hereſy, for holding either opinion: Yea, the Latines Demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſome of the Greeke Fathers ſpake as they did; neither, could the Greekes deny it. And ſince this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate Cenſure of <hi>Photius,</hi> not a few of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Divines have, in requitall, accuſed the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:119760:170"/> Greeke Church of the ſame Crime, for holding the Contrary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth cauſe, was the contention about the <hi>Primacy</hi> between the Biſhops of Rome and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. For <hi>Iohn</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Iejunator,</hi> and <hi>Cyriacus</hi> his ſucceſſour Patriarchs of Conſtantinople, were very earneſt with the emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi> to obteine the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle &amp; Authority of Oecumenicall Patriarchs, thereby challenging a Superiority over the Biſhops of the whole Chriſtian World, from the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their City, which was then the Head of the Romane Empire, that of the Weſt being utterly broken, and Rome the Ancient Seate thereof, for that Cauſe looſing its former Dignity. Now, againſt theſe their endeavours <hi>Gregory</hi> the great then Biſhop of Rome, publickly oppoſed himſelfe and taxed them in expreſſe Termes, of Antichriſtian ambition; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall, that, <hi>Dato uni Epiſcopi univerſalis Titulo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquos Sacerdotes honore debito privari,</hi> The giving of the Title of Univerſall Biſhop unto one, doth deprive the other Biſhops of their due Honour. Yet, with in leſſe than two years after his Death, <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, his Succeſſour abtained the ſame Title of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Phocas,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> had ſo much Decried. But the Greeke Prelates would never yeeld to it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fift cauſe, was the buſines of <hi>Images,</hi> which brake out after this contention about the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</hi> For the Emperour <hi>Leo Iſaurus,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Conſtantinus Copronymus,</hi> interdicted the worſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and commanded them to be broken; Both of them, for this Cauſe, being very hatefull to the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:119760:171"/>6. A ſixt cauſe, was the <hi>Pride, Pompe,</hi> and <hi>Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exactions</hi> of the Popes Legates who were yearly ſent from Rome, to carry the Chriſme unto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeventh, and laſt cauſe, was the <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> Empire, cauſed by <hi>Leo</hi> 3. Biſhop of Rome; who ſeeing Italy, and more eſpecially his owne Church and City, dayly vexed, and in danger of imminent Ruine, by the incurſions of the Saracen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> on the Eaſt, &amp; the oppreſſion of the Lombardes from the Weſt; and ſeeing that the Greeke Emperour, at his earneſt ſolicitation, either would not, or could not protect him: <hi>In fine,</hi> he perſwaded the Senate, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome, to elect <hi>Charlemaigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Emperour of the Weſt, which they did; &amp; he accordingly crowned him at Rome, in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peters</hi> Church, uppon <hi>Chriſtmas Day A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Dni</hi> 800.</p>
               <p>Thus, this great <hi>Breach</hi> had its originall both from <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Prelate.</hi> The Emperours became odions to the Popes, for the buſineſſe of Images; and the Popes to the Greeke Emperours, for the Diviſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Then, for the Clergy; The contention about the Primacy made way for the Schiſme. The Pride, Pompe, and Avarice of the Romane Legats, fomented it. Then, the Doctrine of the Proceſſion, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pained with the Depoſition of <hi>Photius,</hi> and the adding of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle [<hi>Filio<expan>

                  </hi>] to the Nicene Creed, on the one ſide; with the retortion of Hereſy, wherewith <hi>Photius</hi> charged the Latine Church, on the other; brought it to the Height. And when the Differences were thus high, then every petty diverſity in matter of Ceremony, or opinion, was a ſufficient occaſion of Cavill, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make the Breach wider.</p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:119760:171"/>
               <p>For, to inſiſt a little upon this laſt. The Greeks ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in both kindes, and give it to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> preſently upon their Baptiſme; but the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts doe neither. They give it alſo in leavened bread, and condemne the contrary uſe; whereas the Church of Rome uſually delivers it in light Wafer-cakes. They admit of Preiſts marriages, that is, the uſe of thoſe wives whom they married before ordination; which the Romaniſts do not. They prohibite the fourth mariage in any Chriſtian as a thing intollerable. They ſolemnize Saturday feſtivally, in memory of the Creation, and eat fleſh therein; forbidding as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, to faſt any Saturday in the yeare, except Eaſter Eve, in memory of our <hi>Saviours</hi> then lying in the Grave. They Eate no bloud, nor any thing ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, in obſervation of that Decree of the Apoſtles. <hi>Act.</hi> 15 28, 29. They obſerve foure <hi>Lents</hi> in the yeare. They reject the religious uſe of maſſy Images, or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in their Churches; though they admit of Pictures or plaine Images. They diſallow private Maſſes, and the ſale of Indulgences, and Pardons; with the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the elevated Hoſt: laſtly, they have their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in a knowne Tongue. In theſe, and ſome other ſmall particulars, they differ in practiſe from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, as in matter of practiſe ſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion too; as about Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, the State of Soules departed &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But, too much of the cauſes, and the ſad effects that followed.
